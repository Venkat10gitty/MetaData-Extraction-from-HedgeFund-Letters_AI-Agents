"Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd.",Daniel S. Loeb,"November 14, 2023",2023.0,3.0,-0.9,S&P 500,-3.3,2.4,"The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure. Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The top five losers for the quarter were Pacific Gas and Electric Co, Microsoft Corp, Hertz Global Holdings Inc, Bath & Body Works Inc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Performance Review and Portfolio Outlook The funds generated small losses in the Third Quarter. Our equity book modestly outperformed broader indices, and both corporate and structured credit (which are roughly 40% of overall exposure) continued to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with less volatility than equity markets. Markets in the Third Quarter were intensely focused on the dramatic moves in long-term interest rates, as 10-year and 30-year US treasury yields climbed 73 and 84 bps, respectively, levels last seen before the GFC. Real interest rates are now firmly positive after several years of dovish monetary policy that proved to be a boon to multiples and financial engineering. While the moves in stocks have seemed violent at times, the market reaction to macro developments in the Third Quarter was quite rational: unprofitable growth stocks, levered companies, and bonds proxies like utilities, real estate and staples were the big underperformers. Our equity portfolio performed relatively well in this environment with shorts significantly underperforming longs for the first time this year. Our long book had limited exposure to bond proxies like staples and real estate, and while our largest equity position (PCG) is a utility, its deeply discounted valuation made it far less vulnerable to rate moves than peers, allowing it to extend its relentless period of outperformance versus the sector. It is hard to overstate the market’s current obsession with balance sheet strength. This is a growing area of focus for the investment team, as major systematic moves generally create great idiosyncratic opportunities that can only be uncovered through old fashioned fundamental research. Distinguishing which companies have real leverage problems versus perceived leverage problems involves thorough analysis of asset sale opportunities, capital structures, and cash flow statements, all areas where Third Point has a durable competitive advantage. Our equity team’s consistent collaboration with our structured credit, corporate credit, and private credit groups provides us real time insights into the broad suite of solutions available to corporates to manage their balance sheets to create or preserve equity value. The current opportunity set in credit is the most attractive overall since 2020. Spreads are not extraordinarily wide, but yields are exceptionally attractive (close to 10% on the JPM Global High Yield Index), and we are seeing wide dispersion between “high quality” and more complex situations. While overall corporate leverage is high, we believe that if the average is disaggregated, the high leverage levels are buried in private credit and public credit leverage remains modest by historical standards. Corporate Credit Update Third Point’s corporate credit portfolio has contributed 1.3% to fund returns on a net basis year to date, and outperformed the JPM Domestic High Yield Index by more than 450bps during that time period. In Q3, we continued to actively trade the portfolio and several event- driven situations either came to fruition or reached their price targets. Every significant new position we initiated was in a security with an upcoming hard catalyst. We are finding many opportunities in improving credits with ‘bulletproof’ securities (by virtue of seniority, security, or both) yielding 10%-13%. Throughout the year we have maintained our focus on relatively defensive industries such as healthcare and telecommunications. We also have concentrated on credits that face challenges in their capital structures or businesses that we believe are temporary and relatively easy to overcome. We expect these situations to generate total returns in the mid-to-upper teens with moderate credit risk. Given this environment, we expect to continue to increase corporate credit exposure in the coming quarters. Structured Credit Update Structured credit remains a compelling asset class in the current market environment. The strategy’s high risk-adjusted yield and lower correlation to the broader markets allows us to invest higher in the capital structure with superior overall yields. The strategy has also contributed 1.3% to fund returns on a net basis year to date. Our mortgage portfolio outperformed relative to the 40% interest rate hedge ratio we have maintained, as home values and non-performing/delinquent loan prices improved. As rates continue to march higher, we have seen renewed interest from various asset managers in credit, particularly structured credit loans, as unlevered yields for residential mortgages and consumer loans have moved into the 8-12% yield context. Money managers and insurance companies were the first to add exposure at the start of the year, and we are now seeing capital inflows from hedge funds and private credit/equity firms. Given our extensive relationship with mortgage servicers, we have been working to improve our liquidation pipelines to maximize total recovery on non-performing loans, which we expect to comprise about 15% of our loan pools on average. This strategy is particularly valuable when the loan-to-value of the mortgages is around 55%, and we have seen an improvement in house prices for the sub-$350,000 home value segment in the last six months. On the ABS side, we were proactive in selling subprime auto ABS earlier in the year and have seen default rates and loss severities increase in the last few months. We believe this is an early indication of a slow reversal in consumer performance. We have focused on more senior cashflows where the de-leveraging profile enables us to reinvest at higher yields and with more liquidity, giving us the option to rotate into distressed asset classes if the opportunity arises. We are spending more time on the commercial real estate sector and believe there will soon be emerging opportunities to invest in senior tranches from forced sellers.

The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed
on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third
Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser
headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure.
Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.
Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private
investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are
determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.
Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.
While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the
indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ
significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All information

As the oldest church in Sweden, and indeed one its oldest buildings, the Storkyrkan has hosted coronations, royal weddings, and high profile funerals, as well as weekly mass for parishioners. It is also home to St. George and the Dragon, a massive sculpture commissioned as tribute to the titular saint following Sweden’s defeat of the Danish army in the late 15th century. Visitors to Stockholm will quickly note something different about viewing the Storkyrkan in person as compared to the cover image; the cathedral recently completed a years-long restoration project to its earlier, Baroque era color scheme. The main building and tower now sport a light pink exterior, and the distressed green patina of the spire has been restored to a copper red color, reversing several centuries of exposure to Sweden’s harsh winters. Located a short distance form the Storkyrkan, you can find one of Alluvial Fund’s newest holdings: Scandic Hotels, which operates a network of hotels in Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki, and several other locations in Scandinavia.

Comparable indexes were up between 4.3% and 5.2%. The increase was broad-based, with several portfolio holdings contributing. Since quarter’s end, indexes have turned sour, with small-caps and micro-caps giving up all year-to-date gains and then some. The likely delay in much-anticipated interest rate cuts has investors feeling less sunny than they did in March. In typical fashion, Alluvial Fund is bearing up well in the fitful markets. Despite benchmark indexes falling 7-8%, I am happy to report that Alluvial Fund is down only about 2% thus far in April.

P10 Inc. was a top Alluvial Fund holding for several years, but in March, I decided to sell our entire position. We parted with our last shares a few days ago. This was a difficult decision, but one I believe was necessary and thoroughly considered. In short, P10 disappointed us one too many times. The early years of our P10 investment were marked by triumph after triumph as the company grew from an OTC-traded shell company to a NYSE-listed diversified alternative assets manager. But then, the trouble set in. Since its December 2021 IPO/uplisting, P10 has cut its cash flow margin target from >55% of revenue to a “mid-40%s” figure. It has managed only one additional acquisition. And management turnover has been high, with multiple higher-ups exiting and selling or registering to sell large blocks of shares. Not exactly a sign of confidence. I still like P10. Their business model is one of the world’s best, with phenomenal returns on capital, nearly zero need to reinvest cash flows, and long-term industry tailwinds. The new CEO is as sharp as they come, with serious deal-making credentials. But P10 has run into the tough reality that creating a true premier diversified alternative investments platform is going to be far more difficult and far more expensive than anticipated. They need more salespeople, more “deals” people, more people in nearly every department, and these people won’t work for cheap. This investment in human capacity is worthwhile, but the financial rewards may not show up for years. Then there is the problem that credibility is rebuilt far more slowly than it was destroyed. P10 has burned a lot of investors since its IPO. When and if P10 starts to show real improvements, it could take several quarters for investors to trust the company once again and send its shares higher. Looking around at the universe of investments available to us, I could no longer justify owning P10 over any of several other potential holdings. So I sold, and re-allocated the proceeds to multiple other ideas. Fortunately, these ideas have already contributed to the fund’s returns. Funny enough, despite its recent tough run, P10 remains one of the fund’s all-time best performing investments. But although I still think P10’s long-term potential is quite strong, my list of “best risk-adjusted ideas” has only a few dozen entries and P10 is no longer one of them. New Holdings The first of Alluvial Fund’s new holdings is McBride plc. Just when I thought I could not find a business more boring than our vegetable canner, Seneca Foods, along came McBride, a major European producer of private label laundry detergents and dishwashing liquids. For years, McBride was a profitable if unspectacular little company, regularly recording mid-single digit operating margins on a flattish revenue trajectory. Then, COVID and the inflationary aftermath walloped the firm, causing input prices to soar. Bad news for a company that did significant sales on long-term fixed price contracts with major supermarket chains and discount retailers. McBride survived by cutting operating costs and renegotiating sales agreements to re-price in tandem with changes in input costs. Now, economic trends are moving strongly in McBride’s favor. Persistently high European inflation has led consumers to make the switch from branded cleaning products to private label products like those McBride supplies. Unit volume is up just as gross margins are rebounding. The company is using its reinvigorated cash flow to reduce debt and plans to reinstitute its dividend later this year. McBride shares have responded positively to the improved results and outlook, but not nearly enough. McBride still trades at just 4.4x my estimate of fiscal 2024 EBITDA and 5.9x fiscal 2024 normalized earnings. Both ratios will come down as net debt declines. Longer term, McBride expects to generate modest revenue growth and to increase its EBITDA margin to 10%. Today’s enterprise value of £320 million could be ~3x EBITDA in just a few years. Alluvial Fund made its initial purchases of McBride shares between GBp 97 and GBp 99, believing the shares are worth GBp 200 today. McBride’s low valuation is emblematic of the London Stock Exchange’s woes. In the wake of both Brexit and the UK’s ongoing economic troubles, investor interest in London-listed small-caps and micro-caps has all but evaporated, leaving plenty of solid little companies trading at or near multi-year lows. I would not be surprised to find other UK opportunities soon. Another new Alluvial holding is Scandic Hotels. Scandic operates a network of 280 hotels with more than 58,000 rooms, mostly in Scandinavia, naturally. These hotels are solid mid-market properties located mainly in city business or cultural districts, meant to attract the casual traveler and business traveler, not the luxury-seeker. See here, here, or here for examples. I have kept up with Scandic for nearly a decade, and I think now is a great time to be a shareholder. Scandic’s operating model is different than most. A typical hotel company builds or buys its properties, financing the transactions with property-level mortgages or portfolio-level bank debt. The financial obligations associated with these debts are predictable, but unforgiving. Principal and interest must be paid no matter how the hotels are performing. The result is significant operating leverage. Instead, Scandic opts to lease its hotels. Nearly all these leases are variable, with some portion of the lease payment based on hotel revenue. The result is increased lease obligations in good years and decreased in bad. Operating leverage is reduced, and the company’s TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 3/31/24 (%) effective financial leverage is far lower than Net Lease Office Properties 8.5 the balance sheet would suggest. Scandic also has a robust loyalty program, which Fitlife Brands Inc. 5.8 generates meaningful pre-paid revenue and lowers working capital intensity. Crawford United Corp. 5.2 McBride plc. 4.7 Like nearly all hotel companies, COVID was MRC Global Inc. 4.1 cataclysmic for Scandic. Scandic managed the crisis by issuing equity and a convertible ECIP Bank Basket 4.0 bond. A few years on, Scandic’s revenues and profits have reached record highs. The Garrett Motion Inc. 3.9 company has extinguished most of its non- Scandic Hotels Group AB 3.8 lease debt and is now less leveraged than at any point in its history as a public company. Unidata S.p.A. 3.7 But unlike other hotel companies, Scandic’s Seneca Foods Corp. 3.3 share continue to trade well below pre- Total, Top Ten 47.0% COVID highs and offer a double-digit free cash flow yield. Part of the discount may be explained by Scandic’s convertible bond, which comes due in October 2024 and converts into common shares at SEK 43.36. Scandic repurchased one-third of the convertible issue in November 2023 and has ample financial capacity to tender for the rest of the issue prior to maturity if it chooses. Once this share overhang is addressed, I believe that Scandic’s valuation will converge toward that of other European hotel operators. Scandic’s 2024 results should be similar to those of 2023. Assuming full conversion of the convertible bond, Scandic’s market capitalization is SEK 12.9 billion. Enterprise value excluding leases is SEK 13.4 billion. If we treat lease obligations as rent expense (a framework that I greatly prefer to use) then 2024 EBITDA should come in at around SEK 2.5 billion, leaving Scandic trading at around 5.4x EBITDA. Scandic will enter 2025 with a simplified balance sheet, little corporate debt, and a robust pipeline of hotel properties to add to its network. I have also purchased a small position in a collection of Mexican stocks. I am long-term bullish on Mexico. While corruption and lawlessness are serious issues, the country’s positive demographics and growing middle class should see discretionary incomes rise in coming years. The country is also benefitting from reshoring, as US manufacturers reassess the wisdom of relying entirely too heavily on China for their supply chain needs. Like many emerging markets, the Mexican stock market is dominated by a few large multinational corporations, banks, telecoms, and holding companies. But at the small end of the market, there are some real gems that have gone largely un-noticed. Two of these are Grupo Herdez and Corporativo Fragua. Grupo Herdez is a blue-chip consumer packaged goods manufacturer. The group’s salsas, dips, mayonnaise, and guacamoles are ubiquitous in Mexican supermarkets and are likely present at your local supermarket as well. Herdez conducts its business through partnerships with well-known American and European companies like McCormick, Hormel, and Barilla. The company is family-owned, allocates capital responsibly, and trades at a bargain 11x earnings. Corporativo Fragua, founded in 1942, operates over 2,400 pharmacies under the Farmacias Guadalajara brand. The company has a stellar track record of growth and profitability, increasing revenues at 14% annually and profits at 17% annually for the last decade. Corporativo Fragua is bigger company than our typical investment, TABLE III: World Allocation, 3/31/24 (%) valued at $4.3 billion in US Dollar terms, but it trades like an obscure micro-cap thanks to United States 63.3 the low liquidity of its shares. Corporativo Eurozone 10.1 Fragua maintains net balance sheet cash and continues to open new drugstores at a rapid Poland 6.0 pace. Shares are up considerably since our United Kingdom 5.7 first purchases, but the company remains a Canada 5.7 value at 16x 2023 earnings. Sweden 5.4 Portfolio Updates Mexico 2.2 In my last letter, I introduced Net Lease Other 1.6 Office Properties, casually adding that I Total 100% expected this holding “would be volatile.” Well, Net Lease has lived up to its bidding, trading everywhere between $17 and $27 in the first quarter before finishing up at $23.80. Little has changed. The company is still engaged in marketing its collection of 54 office properties for sale. Between major sale announcements, Net Lease Office Properties’ share price will move on interest rate expectations. With recent hot inflation data decreasing the chances of a June rate cut, it’s no wonder shares are off their highs. Currently, the market is valuing the enterprise at around $105 per leasable square foot. I continue to think that $130 per square foot is a suitably conservative estimate of asset value, a price that would value Net Lease shares in the mid-$30s. Less restrictive interest rate policy, success in re-leasing or redeveloping lower quality properties, or a generally healthier commercial real estate environment could all provide upside to this valuation. Garrett Motion delivered nice results in February. The company issued strong guidance for 2024 and best of all, indicated it would use nearly all its 2024 free cash flow to repurchase stock. The company wasted no time, buying back a whopping 10 million shares for $90 million on March 6. Garrett will continue to harvest the cash flows from its dominant turbochargers business, investing in creating products for electric vehicles and returning excess cash to shareholders. Investors seem to be waking up to the reality that while electric vehicles are a near-inevitability, it will be a long time still before internal combustion engines lose their relevance. By the time they do, Garrett Motion will have completed the transition to an electric vehicle equipment manufacturer and will have returned billions in capital to investors. MRC Global, our equipment distributor to oil and gas drillers and gas utilities, also had good news for us. The company issued healthy 2024 earnings guidance and revealed a plan to pay off its term loan with a combination of cash flow and a draw on its asset-backed loan facility. The market responded positively, but shares still change hands at just five times 2024 operating cash flow. MRC has also announced it will provide activist hedge fund Engine Capital with a board seat. I welcome the additional oversight that Engine will provide. There is no word on progress toward resolving the situation with the unhappy holder of MRC Global’s convertible preferred shares, but a resolution could come at any time and would serve as a positive catalyst for MRC shares. Talen Energy, also featured in our last letter, is off to a sensational start this year. Last month the company announced the sale of the data center built adjacent to its Susquehanna nuclear generating facility to Amazon for a handsome price, plus a long-term agreement to supply the data center with carbon-free power. A few days later, the company announced an agreement to sell its Texas fossil fuel-burning generation assets to CPS Energy. These deals leave Talen with plenty of capital to return to shareholders. The planned uplisting to a major exchange later this year remains on track. In the short TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 3/31/24 (%) term, I expect Talen to continue selling off its Consumer Staples 17.6 traditional power generation assets to focus Consumer Discretionary 13.4 entirely on nuclear. Looking ahead, I would be surprised if Talen Energy remains an Industrials 13.1 independent public company for too long. Information Technology 12.6 Its assets are simply too good and will attract plenty of attention. Financials 10.6 Real Estate 10.2 Hammond Manufacturing also delivered good results, earning CAD $0.45 per share Communications 9.5 for the fourth quarter and $1.66 for the Materials 8.3 full year. The company’s plant expansion is now finished, and capital expenditures will Energy 4.2 decline markedly. A strong US Dollar helps Health Care 0.5 Hammond as a large portion of revenues are derived from American customers. As I Utilities 0.0 write, the US Dollar is up 3.2% against the Total 100% Canadian Dollar year-to-date. It’s looking like another great year for Hammond. Despite the strong results and positive outlook, Hammond Manufacturing shares trade for just 6.4x earnings and at 4.6x EBITDA. Hammond shares briefly went on a tear earlier this year, surging from $8.25 at year’s end to nearly $14 in early February on no news. I used the inexplicable move to sell a portion of our shares to some very enthusiastic buyers. Then just as quickly as they arrived, the buyers vanished, replaced by steady sellers who have pushed shares back to $10 or so. At current levels, Hammond shares offer excellent value. FitLife Brands has been a good contributor to our results this year. CEO Dayton Judd provided commentary on the MusclePharm acquisition on the company’s inaugural earnings call. Essentially, the acquisition will be worthwhile, financially speaking, if the current levels of MusclePharm product sales are merely maintained, but it will be a tremendous success if the company can reintroduce previous best-selling products. To that end, the company is bringing back the MusclePharm Combat Sport Bar, which sold 25 million units annually at its peak. It will take time to restore any meaningful portion of MusclePharm’s former glories, but this looks like a good start to me. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the results that Crawford United is putting up and the market’s reaction. For the year just ended, Crawford United earned $3.79 per share and produced free cash flow of $4.75 per share. Shares have rallied to the low $40s this year, but still represent a bargain. Crawford’s commercial air handling unit (think industrial HVAC) was the standout last year, with revenues up 23% and operating income up 130%. Results were more subdued at the industrial and transportation segment, but still up from 2022. Looking ahead, I expect continued growth at air handling, improved margins in industrial and transportation, and a solid contribution from the recently acquired Heany Industries. Alluvial Updates I have a few notable items to report. First, Alluvial Fund is closing to new limited partners. Alluvial Fund is approaching $50 million in assets, still tiny in the context of investment funds but a number that blows my mind when I think back to our founding in 2014. $50 million feels right, at least for now. It’s a figure that still allows me to invest in whatever tantalizing opportunities I come across, no matter how small, but large enough that we have our choice of brokers to work with and access to company management is rarely a problem. Assuming I do my job well and the market cooperates, the fund will continue to grow in size, but without additional capital from new limited partners. Existing limited partners are welcome to contribute additional capital, but for everyone else, we will maintain a waitlist in case circumstances change. Even as some doors close, others open. I am happy to announce Alluvial will be launching a new fund later this year! This fund will look very different from Alluvial Fund, with nearly zero overlap in holdings or strategy. Many details remain to be ironed out, but I can provide a general picture of the new fund. It will be: • Small by design in order to access markets and securities with very limited capacity. • Extremely long-term in nature, with an extended lockup period and a near total disregard for short-term performance. • Complicated, thanks to some very unusual global securities and corporate structures. Not well-suited for qualified accounts. • Dedicated entirely to investing in securities backed by and deriving their value from tangible assets. Not algorithms, networks, or brand names, but real estate, mineral resources, livestock, timber, factories and machinery, and anything else that a human being can see and touch. This new fund won’t be right for everyone, but I am excited to introduce something radically different than any other fund out there. Details will follow. In other news, the fine people at Cohen & Company completed the 2023 audit process with their typical professionalism. We distributed the audited financial statements earlier this month. Please let me know if you did not receive a copy. I apologize that K-1s took longer than expected to complete this year. The new K-2 and K-3 sections introduced by the IRS for 2023 were a challenge for our tax preparers. Next year’s tax process should wrap up more quickly. We will host another webinar for limited partners in early May. I look forward to discussing the Alluvial Fund portfolio and strategy and to answering your questions. We will send details this coming week. As I write in nearly every quarterly update, thank you for entrusting your capital to Alluvial. All of my own capital is invested in Alluvial Fund, and I will continue striving to put it to the best possible use. I welcome your inquiries and I hope that you and yours are enjoying good health and good spirits. I look forward to writing to you again in a few months’ time.

Letter to Limited Partners First Quarter 2024

The cover image shows the clock tower of Stockholm Cathedral, or Storkyrkan,
in the old town of Stockholm. As the oldest church in Sweden, and indeed one
its oldest buildings, the Storkyrkan has hosted coronations, royal weddings, and
high profile funerals, as well as weekly mass for parishioners. It is also home to
St. George and the Dragon, a massive sculpture commissioned as tribute to
the titular saint following Sweden’s defeat of the Danish army in the late 15th
century.
Visitors to Stockholm will quickly note something different about viewing the
Storkyrkan in person as compared to the cover image; the cathedral recently
completed a years-long restoration project to its earlier, Baroque era color
scheme. The main building and tower now sport a light pink exterior, and the
distressed green patina of the spire has been restored to a copper red color,
reversing several centuries of exposure to Sweden’s harsh winters.
Located a short distance form the Storkyrkan, you can find one of Alluvial
Fund’s newest holdings: Scandic Hotels, which operates a network of hotels in
Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki, and several other locations in Scandinavia. Read the
letter to learn more about Scandic Hotels.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund is off to a good start this year, rising 6.3% in the first quarter. Comparable indexes
were up between 4.3% and 5.2%. The increase was broad-based, with several portfolio holdings
contributing. Since quarter’s end, indexes have turned sour, with small-caps and micro-caps giving
up all year-to-date gains and then some. The likely delay in much-anticipated interest rate cuts
has investors feeling less sunny than they did in March. In typical fashion, Alluvial Fund is bearing
up well in the fitful markets. Despite benchmark indexes falling 7-8%, I am happy to report that
Alluvial Fund is down only about 2% thus far in April.

Partnership began operations 01/01/2017
You may notice a conspicuous absence in our top holdings list. P10 Inc. was a top Alluvial Fund
holding for several years, but in March, I decided to sell our entire position. We parted with our last
shares a few days ago. This was a difficult decision, but one I believe was necessary and thoroughly
considered. In short, P10 disappointed us one too many times. The early years of our P10
investment were marked by triumph after triumph as the company grew from an OTC-traded shell
company to a NYSE-listed diversified alternative assets manager. But then, the trouble set in. Since
its December 2021 IPO/uplisting, P10 has cut its cash flow margin target from >55% of revenue to
a “mid-40%s” figure. It has managed only one additional acquisition. And management turnover
has been high, with multiple higher-ups exiting and selling or registering to sell large blocks of
shares. Not exactly a sign of confidence.
I still like P10. Their business model is one of the world’s best, with phenomenal returns on capital,
nearly zero need to reinvest cash flows, and long-term industry tailwinds. The new CEO is as sharp
as they come, with serious deal-making credentials. But P10 has run into the tough reality that
creating a true premier diversified alternative investments platform is going to be far more difficult
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

and far more expensive than anticipated. They need more salespeople, more “deals” people,
more people in nearly every department, and these people won’t work for cheap. This investment
in human capacity is worthwhile, but the financial rewards may not show up for years. Then there
is the problem that credibility is rebuilt far more slowly than it was destroyed. P10 has burned a lot
of investors since its IPO. When and if P10 starts to show real improvements, it could take several
quarters for investors to trust the company once again and send its shares higher.
Looking around at the universe of investments available to us, I could no longer justify owning P10
over any of several other potential holdings. So I sold, and re-allocated the proceeds to multiple
other ideas. Fortunately, these ideas have already contributed to the fund’s returns. Funny enough,
despite its recent tough run, P10 remains one of the fund’s all-time best performing investments.
But although I still think P10’s long-term potential is quite strong, my list of “best risk-adjusted
ideas” has only a few dozen entries and P10 is no longer one of them.
New Holdings
The first of Alluvial Fund’s new holdings is McBride plc. Just when I thought I could not find a
business more boring than our vegetable canner, Seneca Foods, along came McBride, a major
European producer of private label laundry detergents and dishwashing liquids. For years,
McBride was a profitable if unspectacular little company, regularly recording mid-single digit
operating margins on a flattish revenue trajectory. Then, COVID and the inflationary aftermath
walloped the firm, causing input prices to soar. Bad news for a company that did significant sales
on long-term fixed price contracts with major supermarket chains and discount retailers. McBride
survived by cutting operating costs and renegotiating sales agreements to re-price in tandem with
changes in input costs. Now, economic trends are moving strongly in McBride’s favor. Persistently
high European inflation has led consumers to make the switch from branded cleaning products
to private label products like those McBride supplies. Unit volume is up just as gross margins
are rebounding. The company is using its reinvigorated cash flow to reduce debt and plans to
reinstitute its dividend later this year. McBride shares have responded positively to the improved
results and outlook, but not nearly enough. McBride still trades at just 4.4x my estimate of fiscal
2024 EBITDA and 5.9x fiscal 2024 normalized earnings. Both ratios will come down as net debt
declines. Longer term, McBride expects to generate modest revenue growth and to increase its
EBITDA margin to 10%. Today’s enterprise value of £320 million could be ~3x EBITDA in just a few
years. Alluvial Fund made its initial purchases of McBride shares between GBp 97 and GBp 99,
believing the shares are worth GBp 200 today.
McBride’s low valuation is emblematic of the London Stock Exchange’s woes. In the wake of both
Brexit and the UK’s ongoing economic troubles, investor interest in London-listed small-caps and
micro-caps has all but evaporated, leaving plenty of solid little companies trading at or near multi-
year lows. I would not be surprised to find other UK opportunities soon.
Another new Alluvial holding is Scandic Hotels. Scandic operates a network of 280 hotels with
more than 58,000 rooms, mostly in Scandinavia, naturally. These hotels are solid mid-market
properties located mainly in city business or cultural districts, meant to attract the casual traveler
and business traveler, not the luxury-seeker. See here, here, or here for examples. I have kept up
with Scandic for nearly a decade, and I think now is a great time to be a shareholder.

Scandic’s operating model is different than most. A typical hotel company builds or buys its
properties, financing the transactions with property-level mortgages or portfolio-level bank debt.
The financial obligations associated with these debts are predictable, but unforgiving. Principal and
interest must be paid no matter how the hotels are performing. The result is significant operating

McBride plc. 4.7
Like nearly all hotel companies, COVID was

cataclysmic for Scandic. Scandic managed
the crisis by issuing equity and a convertible ECIP Bank Basket 4.0
bond. A few years on, Scandic’s revenues
Garrett Motion Inc. 3.9
and profits have reached record highs. The
company has extinguished most of its non- Scandic Hotels Group AB 3.8
lease debt and is now less leveraged than at
Unidata S.p.A. 3.7
any point in its history as a public company.
But unlike other hotel companies, Scandic’s Seneca Foods Corp. 3.3
share continue to trade well below pre-
Total, Top Ten 47.0%
COVID highs and offer a double-digit free
cash flow yield. Part of the discount may be
explained by Scandic’s convertible bond, which comes due in October 2024 and converts into
common shares at SEK 43.36. Scandic repurchased one-third of the convertible issue in November
2023 and has ample financial capacity to tender for the rest of the issue prior to maturity if it
chooses. Once this share overhang is addressed, I believe that Scandic’s valuation will converge
toward that of other European hotel operators.
Scandic’s 2024 results should be similar to those of 2023. Assuming full conversion of the
convertible bond, Scandic’s market capitalization is SEK 12.9 billion. Enterprise value excluding
leases is SEK 13.4 billion. If we treat lease obligations as rent expense (a framework that I greatly
prefer to use) then 2024 EBITDA should come in at around SEK 2.5 billion, leaving Scandic trading
at around 5.4x EBITDA. Scandic will enter 2025 with a simplified balance sheet, little corporate
debt, and a robust pipeline of hotel properties to add to its network.
I have also purchased a small position in a collection of Mexican stocks. I am long-term bullish on
Mexico. While corruption and lawlessness are serious issues, the country’s positive demographics
and growing middle class should see discretionary incomes rise in coming years. The country is
also benefitting from reshoring, as US manufacturers reassess the wisdom of relying entirely too
heavily on China for their supply chain needs. Like many emerging markets, the Mexican stock
market is dominated by a few large multinational corporations, banks, telecoms, and holding

In my last letter, I introduced Net Lease

expected this holding “would be volatile.”
Total 100%
Well, Net Lease has lived up to its bidding,
trading everywhere between $17 and $27
in the first quarter before finishing up at $23.80. Little has changed. The company is still engaged
in marketing its collection of 54 office properties for sale. Between major sale announcements,
Net Lease Office Properties’ share price will move on interest rate expectations. With recent hot
inflation data decreasing the chances of a June rate cut, it’s no wonder shares are off their highs.
Currently, the market is valuing the enterprise at around $105 per leasable square foot. I continue
to think that $130 per square foot is a suitably conservative estimate of asset value, a price that
would value Net Lease shares in the mid-$30s. Less restrictive interest rate policy, success in re-

MRC Global, our equipment distributor to oil and gas drillers and gas utilities, also had good
news for us. The company issued healthy 2024 earnings guidance and revealed a plan to pay
off its term loan with a combination of cash flow and a draw on its asset-backed loan facility. The
market responded positively, but shares still change hands at just five times 2024 operating cash

I welcome the additional oversight that Engine will provide. There is no word on progress toward

Despite the strong results and positive outlook, Hammond Manufacturing shares trade for just 6.4x
earnings and at 4.6x EBITDA. Hammond shares briefly went on a tear earlier this year, surging from
$8.25 at year’s end to nearly $14 in early February on no news. I used the inexplicable move to sell
a portion of our shares to some very enthusiastic buyers. Then just as quickly as they arrived, the
buyers vanished, replaced by steady sellers who have pushed shares back to $10 or so. At current
levels, Hammond shares offer excellent value.
FitLife Brands has been a good contributor to our results this year. CEO Dayton Judd provided
commentary on the MusclePharm acquisition on the company’s inaugural earnings call. Essentially,
the acquisition will be worthwhile, financially speaking, if the current levels of MusclePharm
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

product sales are merely maintained, but it will be a tremendous success if the company can
reintroduce previous best-selling products. To that end, the company is bringing back the
MusclePharm Combat Sport Bar, which sold 25 million units annually at its peak. It will take time to
restore any meaningful portion of MusclePharm’s former glories, but this looks like a good start to
me.
Finally, I could not be more pleased with the results that Crawford United is putting up and the
market’s reaction. For the year just ended, Crawford United earned $3.79 per share and produced
free cash flow of $4.75 per share. Shares have rallied to the low $40s this year, but still represent
a bargain. Crawford’s commercial air handling unit (think industrial HVAC) was the standout last
year, with revenues up 23% and operating income up 130%. Results were more subdued at the
industrial and transportation segment, but still up from 2022. Looking ahead, I expect continued
growth at air handling, improved margins in industrial and transportation, and a solid contribution
from the recently acquired Heany Industries.
Alluvial Updates
I have a few notable items to report. First, Alluvial Fund is closing to new limited partners. Alluvial
Fund is approaching $50 million in assets, still tiny in the context of investment funds but a number
that blows my mind when I think back to our founding in 2014. $50 million feels right, at least for
now. It’s a figure that still allows me to invest in whatever tantalizing opportunities I come across,
no matter how small, but large enough that we have our choice of brokers to work with and
access to company management is rarely a problem. Assuming I do my job well and the market
cooperates, the fund will continue to grow in size, but without additional capital from new limited
partners. Existing limited partners are welcome to contribute additional capital, but for everyone
else, we will maintain a waitlist in case circumstances change.
Even as some doors close, others open. I am happy to announce Alluvial will be launching a new
fund later this year! This fund will look very different from Alluvial Fund, with nearly zero overlap in
holdings or strategy. Many details remain to be ironed out, but I can provide a general picture of
the new fund. It will be:
• Small by design in order to access markets and securities with very limited capacity.
• Extremely long-term in nature, with an extended lockup period and a near total disregard
for short-term performance.
• Complicated, thanks to some very unusual global securities and corporate structures. Not
well-suited for qualified accounts.
• Dedicated entirely to investing in securities backed by and deriving their value from
tangible assets. Not algorithms, networks, or brand names, but real estate, mineral resources,
livestock, timber, factories and machinery, and anything else that a human being can see and
touch.
This new fund won’t be right for everyone, but I am excited to introduce something radically
different than any other fund out there. Details will follow.
In other news, the fine people at Cohen & Company completed the 2023 audit process with their
typical professionalism. We distributed the audited financial statements earlier this month. Please

let me know if you did not receive a copy. I apologize that K-1s took longer than expected to
complete this year. The new K-2 and K-3 sections introduced by the IRS for 2023 were a challenge
for our tax preparers. Next year’s tax process should wrap up more quickly.
We will host another webinar for limited partners in early May. I look forward to discussing the
Alluvial Fund portfolio and strategy and to answering your questions. We will send details this
coming week.
As I write in nearly every quarterly update, thank you for entrusting your capital to Alluvial. All of
my own capital is invested in Alluvial Fund, and I will continue striving to put it to the best possible
use. I welcome your inquiries and I hope that you and yours are enjoying good health and good
spirits. I look forward to writing to you again in a few months’ time.

The speed with which Net Lease has sold off properties and paid down its debt is impressive. Just six months ago, the company owned 47 properties and carried recourse debt of $215 million. Today, Net Lease is down to 39 properties and $61 million in recourse debt. I expect the company’s remaining recourse debt to be extinguished this quarter or next, allowing the company to begin distributing the proceeds of its property sales to shareholders. Net Lease shares have performed very well since we first started buying them one year ago, but their price remains deeply discounted against any reasonable estimate of asset value. The headwinds facing the office market have scarcely abated, and interest rates are being stubbornly slow to decline, but if Net Lease can continue selling its properties at 8-12% cash flow yields, eventually there will be nothing left to sell and shareholders will have received far more than the current trading price in distributions. Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3 Lest anyone think I am being too sanguine about Net Lease’s prospects, I do make allowance for the fact that some lower quality or “quirkier” properties may prove difficult to sell or fetch disappointing prices. The company’s largest remaining property, a 1 million square foot Houston building leased to KBR, might be one such property. It’s an older building in an office market with high vacancy. Hard to imagine the list of interested buyers is currently very long or feeling very spendy. On the plus side, KBR’s lease runs for another 5.4 years, and Net Lease will receive another $115 million in rents. Discounted at 10%, that’s a present value of $86 million. It’s very possible that the Houston office market will improve by 2030 and that the building will have significant terminal value. But even if the property is totally worthless in five years (unlikely), the present value of remaining contractual rent payments alone is $80 per square foot. If I repeat this process with Net Lease’s other “difficult” properties, applying punitive outcomes, I still get to a value per Net Lease Office Properties share in the high $30s. My “realistic scenario” valuation remains $45 per share. In my last letter, I expressed my conviction that international investing still makes sense, and that this long stretch of underperformance by non-US markets cannot and will not continue forever. I was promptly rewarded by yet another quarter in which US equity markets trounced global TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 12/31/24 (%) stocks. When will I learn not to tempt fate? At this point in the market cycle, it seems Net Lease Office Properties 10.2 American equities are viewed as a “sure Zegona Communications plc. 6.9 thing,” with everything else not worth the risk. Fitlife Brands Inc. 6.2 Now, a few words about risk. It profits little McBride plc. 6.1 to waste time and energy fretting over all the ECIP Bank Basket 4.2 risks that may possibly impact an investment. Recognize them, incorporate them into the Titan Cement International SA 4.1 valuation process, then move on. Generally Talen Energy Inc. 4.0 speaking, it is the risks we can’t anticipate that wind up hurting us anyway. There’s a simple Crawford United Corp. 3.7 mental exercise I like to undertake, and that MRC Global Inc. 3.7 is to inventory what I am currently worrying about, portfolio-wise, and ask myself if any of Seneca Foods Corp. 3.6 these worries were anywhere on my radar 5 Total, Top Ten 52.8% years ago. Persistent inflation? No. A global slide toward authoritarianism? No. Illogical, inflationary, and economically destructive tariffs? OK, maybe just a bit. Point is, the actual risks our investments face are rarely the known risks making us sweat today. Few besides a handful of epidemiologists were worried about a global pandemic in 2015, yet COVID hit like a tidal wave. In 2017, nobody besides a few astute intelligence analysts expected Putin to invade Ukraine, but the war came anyway and profoundly affected the European and world economies. The lesson here is that the events that will have the largest impacts on our portfolio over the next five years are probably not the things we are worrying about now. In my view, the best hedge against these unknown risks is boring but effective: a diversified portfolio of businesses from many different industries and geographies, with a strong preference for robust balance sheets, predictable cash flows, and capable management teams. And yes, not all of them should be American. Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4 Alluvial Fund has large holdings in two UK-listed stocks, Zegona Communications Plc and McBride Plc. Until this week, I was prepared to use some hackneyed “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” Charles Dickens reference to contrast the diverging performance of each. Thankfully, a cheery trading update from McBride Plc has McBride shares showing some life this month, putting them back in “best of times” territory with Zegona. McBride is our British private label soaps and detergents manufacturer that got itself in hot water thanks to surging COVID-era input costs. We invested as it was becoming clear that McBride had turned the corner, getting its margins under control thanks to efficiency initiatives and amended customer contracts, and rapidly reducing debt. Shares rallied after our purchase, but slumped all summer as a procession of downbeat economic news from across the Atlantic and continued disinterest in the UK stock market took their toll. The slide was nothing short of perplexing to me, as McBride is about as defensive as a company can be. A moribund British and Continental European economy is good for McBride as it results in stressed consumers trading down from name brand cleaning products to private labels. We added to our position all summer and fall, building our Alluvial Fund holdings to 3 million McBride shares. McBride’s January 17 first half trading update was, as the Brits might say, “cracking.” The company revealed strong volume growth and operating income up 8% year-over-year. Net debt fell to a new low of 117.6 million, and the company indicated it would resume paying dividends next fiscal year. Shares promptly rallied from GBp 101 to GBp 117. Even after the move, McBride trades at only 3.6x EBITDA and just 5 times forward earnings. There is plenty of room for McBride shares to climb before reaching fair value. McBride shares are a bargain anywhere below GBp 200. Zegona is a London-listed investment company that undertook a leveraged buyout of under-performing Spanish telecom, Vodafone Spain. In my last letter, I outlined the initiatives that Zegona would pursue to improve profitability and optimize the balance sheet. I am pleased to report that excellent progress is being made, and that Zegona shares have responded accordingly. The company’s September 30 report showed stabilizing revenues and greatly improved cash flow. The planned sale of Vodafone Spain’s fiber-optic assets is moving ahead nicely, with both deals expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. Following the asset sale, Zegona will pay down a substantial portion of its acquisition debt and will likely declare a large shareholder distribution. Despite the healthy move in Zegona Communications shares, the company trades at less than half my estimate of fair value. The company’s operational turnaround is still in the early stages, and the complicated financials makes the ongoing value creation easy to miss. With multiple catalysts on the horizon, I have Great Expectations for Zegona. Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5 We have owned Garrett Motion shares since we participated in the company’s recapitalization in 2021. The theory behind our investment was that Garrett Motion’s core turbocharger business would decline much more slowly than the market expected, and that the company could reinvest in electric vehicle technologies and return tremendous amounts of capital to shareholders. The thesis has largely borne out. The global transition to electric vehicles, while still progressing, will take longer than expected and turbocharger technology will remain relevant for many more years. Garrett is returning nearly all its free cash flow to shareholders, while dedicating more than $100 million annually to research and development for electric vehicle technologies. Garrett Motion’s share count has declined by 12% in the last year. Despite all these developments, Garrett Motion shares remain stubbornly rangebound, bouncing between the mid-$8s and $9s. Why these doldrums? Garrett Motion’s share structure is the biggest culprit. As of April 2024, just four hedge funds owned 56% of Garrett Motion shares. These funds have since reduced their holdings by almost 16 million shares and are likely to continue selling as they move on to other opportunities in distressed securities. The continued selling by large holders has pressured Garrett Motion shares, but at least the company is aware of the opportunity and plans to dedicate nearly all its free cash flow to repurchases. In December, the company made its capital allocation policy explicit, initiating a dividend and committing to returning at least 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. It will take time, but eventually the selling shareholders will run out of shares to sell, and Garrett Motion will have bought back a large portion of the company at free cash flow yields in the high teens or better. For the second year running, Crawford United made a January acquisition, this time buying Rahn Industries for $13 million. Rahn produces HVAC coils, critically important components for Crawford’s growing Air Handling segment. I have come to accept that the market simply will not consistently capitalize Crawford United at more than 9-10 times earnings, no matter how many savvy acquisitions the company makes or how rosy the outlook. Still, it hardly matters, because Crawford reliably churns out a 20% return on equity. A company that can do that 4 years in a row doubles its book value, assuming it reinvests all earnings. There’s a lesson here, one that I would love to go back in time and teach myself at the beginning of my investing career. It’s this: buying crummy little companies with illiquid shares is a tough, tough way to make money, no matter how cheaply you buy them. You have to hope that management wakes up and decides to sell the company, or that business conditions somehow improve, or that some opportunistic competitor lobs a bid. The waiting is excruciating and the opportunity cost is ruinous. On the other hand, buying very good small companies with illiquid shares is a great way to make money! Sure, shares may stay stubbornly cheap for a while, but they eventually move in tandem with the increases in company value, and the intrinsic value of a good company is always increasing. I honestly cannot think of a case where a company, no matter how small or how illiquid its shares, doubled its earnings power in sustainable fashion over 4-5 years without its shares responding. This has been our experience with Crawford United, where shares are up 4x over our holding period despite rarely trading at a double-digit price-to-earnings multiple. EACO Corp. and Rand Worldwide Inc. also spring to mind as examples of the phenomenon. Our ECIP banks had a mostly quiet quarter, but United Bancorporation of Alabama found a clever way to repurchase a big block of stock. For quite some time management has been open about how its desire to repurchase stock has been stymied by low trading volume and the lack of willing sellers owning substantial quantities of shares. But in November, the company announced Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6 it had negotiated the repurchase of the 197,717 company shares held by the company 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan, reducing shares outstanding by 5.6%. Nicely accretive to earnings per share. I commend them. Elsewhere in ECIP-land, multiple banks have negotiated option agreements with the US Treasury that will allow them to repurchase the preferred shares held by the Treasury at a discount to par, provided certain lending thresholds have TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 12/31/24 (%) been met. I expect to see additional option Consumer Staples 19.1 announcements from other ECIP banks soon. Real Estate 15.8 Now, the new. The fund’s most significant Communications 14.3 new holding is Titan Cement International SA. It’s no secret we’re cement fans here at Financials 12.6 Alluvial HQ. Monarch Cement, Boston Sand & Information Technology 10.0 Gravel, and Cementos Argos SA are all fund holdings and all have treated us very well. A Materials 9.5 wave of infrastructure investment, combined Consumer Discretionary 7.2 with a long period of underinvestment in domestic cement production capacity have Industrials 5.9 resulted in heady times for American cement Utilities 4.1 producers, with most reporting record profits and a healthy outlook. Valuations have risen Energy 1.4 in tandem with results, and the industry Health Care 0.2 now trades at 9-12x EBITDA or even higher, depending on size, location, and product Total 100% mix. This optimism has not extended to cement producers in Europe, many of which are valued at 5-7x EBITDA. This includes Titan Cement, a Greek company with operations in Southern and Southeastern Europe, Egypt, Turkey, and a joint venture in Brazil. Oh, and a large US business that contributes more than half of the company’s revenue and earnings. Titan Cement got tired of its depressed valuation and decided to do something about it. Seeing that US cement producers are valued at a premium of 50% or more to European cement producers, Titan decided to IPO a portion of its US business. “Titan America SA” will soon list on the NYSE. Titan shares have responded well to the news, but they remain attractively priced. Assuming Titan America SA is valued at 8-9x EBITDA, the market is still ascribing nearly zero value to Titan’s profitable non-US operations. Titan has not yet discussed its plan for the cash influx it will receive from the partial divestiture of Titan America, but the company has a history of good financial stewardship. Titan Cement International SA shares trade in Athens and Brussels at around €44, but are worth at least €60. Our other notable new holding is CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. I consider CBL another expression of our “long-term commercial property recovery” theme, where we seek to buy fundamentally sound real estate that will benefit from gradually improving sentiment. CBL is an operator of traditional malls, outlet malls, open air shopping centers, and lifestyle properties. CBL entered bankruptcy during the COVID crisis, shedding debt and reemerging in 2021. There’s no question that the mall business is not what it used to be, but CBL has done an admirable job in reducing leverage, investing in its best properties, and returning capital to shareholders. Today, CBL owns a portfolio of 87 properties and manages 4 others for third parties. The portfolio ranges Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7 in quality from “Class A-ish” malls doing $500+ of annual sales per square foot, to challenged properties in tertiary markets. CBL’s value is concentrated in its best properties, but the lower- quality properties still produce cash and the company is actively marketing some for sale. I value CBL shares at $40-45. At $28, CBL trades at an attractive discount to fair value, but I am also attracted by the low downside risk. The company has almost $9 per share in excess cash and owns a collection of properties totally unencumbered by debt. These properties produced $66 million in 2023 cash flow. At 7x cash flow, these properties are worth another $15 per CBL share. Together with the cash, that’s value of $24 per share before considering any of the debt- encumbered properties. And there is plenty of value there, too. Some of CBL’s properties are owned by a holding company that carries a term loan of $730 million. As long as these properties are worth more than 5.5x cash flow, CBL’s equity in the holding company has value. CBL also has numerous properties with non-recourse property debt. Some of these properties are not currently cash-flowing for CBL because their cash flow is insufficient to satisfy their debt service ratios. These represent pure optionality for CBL. Either things don’t improve and CBL hands the keys to the lenders, the lenders agree to restructure the debt and the properties become cash-flowing again, or property performance improves and the debt service issue is resolved. There’s no way these properties can be actual liabilities for CBL, and plenty of ways they can have value again. CBL’s best properties are mainly held through joint ventures with other operators. The company is working to consolidate some of these, and just announced the purchase of its JV partners’ interests in three malls in Nashville, Kansas City, and St. Louis. Like our other commercial property holdings, CBL & Associates Properties has its fair share of challenges. But there are plenty of encouraging signs. CBL’s net operating income was steady from 2023 to 2024, and occupancy ticked higher in the third quarter. The company’s debt burden is very manageable and shrinking monthly from scheduled amortization and property sales. It’s unlikely that investors will wake up tomorrow, decide malls are the future of commerce, and bid CBL shares to $80 or $100. But I do think the combination of strong cash flow, continued debt reduction, strategic reinvestment in CBL’s best assets, and healthy distributions and share repurchases will drive shares higher this year and next. Looking back over the years, some of our best investments have been in companies that were deeply stigmatized and out-of-favor, but had valuable tangible assets, healthy cash flow, and management capable of maximizing the value of each. CBL certainly qualifies. Expert Markets Updates Alluvial Fund holds a collection of securities that trade on the expert market, the home of securities whose issuers have ceased providing public financial information. Most brokers do not offer access to the Expert Market, but the fine folks at Odeon Capital Group LLC execute expert market trades for us. By necessity, our expert market holdings are long-term in nature: equities I am happy to hold for many years, or fixed income instruments that offer attractive yields (due to expert market illiquidity and obscurity, not shaky credit). Our expert market holdings represent 5% of the Alluvial Fund portfolio and include: • A preferred share issued by a specialty shipping company. This preferred is cumulative and yields >13%, with strong asset and cash flow coverage. • A baby bond issued by an investment management firm. The bond matures in 3 Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 8 years and yields 15% to maturity, more than 500 basis points higher than parent company bonds. • Cuisine Solutions, a profitable and growing foodtech company. Cuisine Solutions invented the popular Starbucks Egg Bites and counts Bain Capital among its investors. I look forward to attending the shareholder meeting next month. See anyone there? • A helicopter owner and operator with medical and oil & gas service segments, with net balance sheet cash and trading at <4x EBITDA. I suspect this company will eventually IPO or be sold. • Mechanics Bank of Richmond, a private equity-held bank that will eventually be sold. As one of California’s largest remaining local banks, Mechanics is a real prize. And more! Expert market stocks will remain a small part of our overarching strategy due to the severe liquidity constraints involved, but these securities are remarkably well-valued and I am happy to hold them for the long run. Other Updates Thank you for reading and for the privilege of managing capital on your behalf. Eight years in, I have never been more excited to wake up each day and resume the hunt for our next great investment. I’d like to remind everyone that in addition to these quarterly letters and bi-annual conference calls, I also write about stocks and investing at alluvial.substack.com.

Just six months ago, the company owned 47 properties and carried recourse debt of $215
million. Today, Net Lease is down to 39 properties and $61 million in recourse debt. I expect the
company’s remaining recourse debt to be extinguished this quarter or next, allowing the company
to begin distributing the proceeds of its property sales to shareholders. Net Lease shares have
performed very well since we first started buying them one year ago, but their price remains
deeply discounted against any reasonable estimate of asset value. The headwinds facing the
office market have scarcely abated, and interest rates are being stubbornly slow to decline, but
if Net Lease can continue selling its properties at 8-12% cash flow yields, eventually there will be
nothing left to sell and shareholders will have received far more than the current trading price in
distributions.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

Lest anyone think I am being too sanguine about Net Lease’s prospects, I do make allowance
for the fact that some lower quality or “quirkier” properties may prove difficult to sell or fetch
disappointing prices. The company’s largest remaining property, a 1 million square foot Houston
building leased to KBR, might be one such property. It’s an older building in an office market with
high vacancy. Hard to imagine the list of interested buyers is currently very long or feeling very
spendy. On the plus side, KBR’s lease runs for another 5.4 years, and Net Lease will receive another
$115 million in rents. Discounted at 10%, that’s a present value of $86 million. It’s very possible that
the Houston office market will improve by 2030 and that the building will have significant terminal
value. But even if the property is totally worthless in five years (unlikely), the present value of
remaining contractual rent payments alone is $80 per square foot. If I repeat this process with Net
Lease’s other “difficult” properties, applying punitive outcomes, I still get to a value per Net Lease
Office Properties share in the high $30s. My “realistic scenario” valuation remains $45 per share.
In my last letter, I expressed my conviction that international investing still makes sense, and that
this long stretch of underperformance by non-US markets cannot and will not continue forever. I
was promptly rewarded by yet another quarter
in which US equity markets trounced global

years ago. Persistent inflation? No. A global
slide toward authoritarianism? No. Illogical,

our investments face are rarely the known risks making us sweat today. Few besides a handful of
epidemiologists were worried about a global pandemic in 2015, yet COVID hit like a tidal wave.
In 2017, nobody besides a few astute intelligence analysts expected Putin to invade Ukraine, but
the war came anyway and profoundly affected the European and world economies. The lesson
here is that the events that will have the largest impacts on our portfolio over the next five years
are probably not the things we are worrying about now. In my view, the best hedge against these
unknown risks is boring but effective: a diversified portfolio of businesses from many different
industries and geographies, with a strong preference for robust balance sheets, predictable cash
flows, and capable management teams. And yes, not all of them should be American.

Alluvial Fund has large holdings in two UK-listed stocks, Zegona Communications Plc and
McBride Plc. Until this week, I was prepared to use some hackneyed “It was the best of times, it
was the worst of times” Charles Dickens reference to contrast the diverging performance of each.
Thankfully, a cheery trading update from McBride Plc has McBride shares showing some life this
month, putting them back in “best of times” territory with Zegona.
McBride is our British private label soaps and detergents manufacturer that got itself in hot water
thanks to surging COVID-era input costs. We invested as it was becoming clear that McBride had
turned the corner, getting its margins under control thanks to efficiency initiatives and amended
customer contracts, and rapidly reducing debt. Shares rallied after our purchase, but slumped
all summer as a procession of downbeat economic news from across the Atlantic and continued
disinterest in the UK stock market took their toll. The slide was nothing short of perplexing to
me, as McBride is about as defensive as a company can be. A moribund British and Continental
European economy is good for McBride as it results in stressed consumers trading down from
name brand cleaning products to private labels. We added to our position all summer and fall,
building our Alluvial Fund holdings to 3 million McBride shares. McBride’s January 17 first half
trading update was, as the Brits might say, “cracking.” The company revealed strong volume
growth and operating income up 8% year-over-year. Net debt fell to a new low of 117.6 million,
and the company indicated it would resume paying dividends next fiscal year. Shares promptly
rallied from GBp 101 to GBp 117. Even after
the move, McBride trades at only 3.6x EBITDA
TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/24 (%)
and just 5 times forward earnings. There is
plenty of room for McBride shares to climb United States 63.2
before reaching fair value. McBride shares are

The company’s September 30 report showed
stabilizing revenues and greatly improved cash flow. The planned sale of Vodafone Spain’s fiber-
optic assets is moving ahead nicely, with both deals expected to be completed in the first half
of 2025. Following the asset sale, Zegona will pay down a substantial portion of its acquisition
debt and will likely declare a large shareholder distribution. Despite the healthy move in Zegona
Communications shares, the company trades at less than half my estimate of fair value. The
company’s operational turnaround is still in the early stages, and the complicated financials makes
the ongoing value creation easy to miss. With multiple catalysts on the horizon, I have Great
Expectations for Zegona.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

We have owned Garrett Motion shares since we participated in the company’s recapitalization
in 2021. The theory behind our investment was that Garrett Motion’s core turbocharger business
would decline much more slowly than the market expected, and that the company could reinvest
in electric vehicle technologies and return tremendous amounts of capital to shareholders. The
thesis has largely borne out. The global transition to electric vehicles, while still progressing, will
take longer than expected and turbocharger technology will remain relevant for many more years.
Garrett is returning nearly all its free cash flow to shareholders, while dedicating more than $100
million annually to research and development for electric vehicle technologies. Garrett Motion’s
share count has declined by 12% in the last year. Despite all these developments, Garrett Motion
shares remain stubbornly rangebound, bouncing between the mid-$8s and $9s. Why these
doldrums? Garrett Motion’s share structure is the biggest culprit. As of April 2024, just four hedge
funds owned 56% of Garrett Motion shares. These funds have since reduced their holdings by
almost 16 million shares and are likely to continue selling as they move on to other opportunities in
distressed securities. The continued selling by large holders has pressured Garrett Motion shares,
but at least the company is aware of the opportunity and plans to dedicate nearly all its free cash
flow to repurchases. In December, the company made its capital allocation policy explicit, initiating
a dividend and committing to returning at least 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. It will
take time, but eventually the selling shareholders will run out of shares to sell, and Garrett Motion
will have bought back a large portion of the company at free cash flow yields in the high teens or
better.
For the second year running, Crawford United made a January acquisition, this time buying
Rahn Industries for $13 million. Rahn produces HVAC coils, critically important components for
Crawford’s growing Air Handling segment. I have come to accept that the market simply will not
consistently capitalize Crawford United at more than 9-10 times earnings, no matter how many
savvy acquisitions the company makes or how rosy the outlook. Still, it hardly matters, because
Crawford reliably churns out a 20% return on equity. A company that can do that 4 years in a row
doubles its book value, assuming it reinvests all earnings. There’s a lesson here, one that I would
love to go back in time and teach myself at the beginning of my investing career. It’s this: buying
crummy little companies with illiquid shares is a tough, tough way to make money, no matter how
cheaply you buy them. You have to hope that management wakes up and decides to sell the
company, or that business conditions somehow improve, or that some opportunistic competitor
lobs a bid. The waiting is excruciating and the opportunity cost is ruinous. On the other hand,
buying very good small companies with illiquid shares is a great way to make money! Sure, shares
may stay stubbornly cheap for a while, but they eventually move in tandem with the increases in
company value, and the intrinsic value of a good company is always increasing. I honestly cannot
think of a case where a company, no matter how small or how illiquid its shares, doubled its
earnings power in sustainable fashion over 4-5 years without its shares responding. This has been
our experience with Crawford United, where shares are up 4x over our holding period despite
rarely trading at a double-digit price-to-earnings multiple. EACO Corp. and Rand Worldwide Inc.
also spring to mind as examples of the phenomenon.
Our ECIP banks had a mostly quiet quarter, but United Bancorporation of Alabama found a
clever way to repurchase a big block of stock. For quite some time management has been open
about how its desire to repurchase stock has been stymied by low trading volume and the lack of
willing sellers owning substantial quantities of shares. But in November, the company announced
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

it had negotiated the repurchase of the 197,717 company shares held by the company 401(k)
Employee Stock Ownership Plan, reducing shares outstanding by 5.6%. Nicely accretive to
earnings per share. I commend them. Elsewhere in ECIP-land, multiple banks have negotiated
option agreements with the US Treasury that will allow them to repurchase the preferred shares
held by the Treasury at a discount to par,
provided certain lending thresholds have

now trades at 9-12x EBITDA or even higher,

mix. This optimism has not extended to
cement producers in Europe, many of which are valued at 5-7x EBITDA. This includes Titan
Cement, a Greek company with operations in Southern and Southeastern Europe, Egypt, Turkey,
and a joint venture in Brazil. Oh, and a large US business that contributes more than half of the
company’s revenue and earnings. Titan Cement got tired of its depressed valuation and decided
to do something about it. Seeing that US cement producers are valued at a premium of 50% or
more to European cement producers, Titan decided to IPO a portion of its US business. “Titan
America SA” will soon list on the NYSE. Titan shares have responded well to the news, but they
remain attractively priced. Assuming Titan America SA is valued at 8-9x EBITDA, the market is still
ascribing nearly zero value to Titan’s profitable non-US operations. Titan has not yet discussed its
plan for the cash influx it will receive from the partial divestiture of Titan America, but the company
has a history of good financial stewardship. Titan Cement International SA shares trade in Athens
and Brussels at around €44, but are worth at least €60.
Our other notable new holding is CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. I consider CBL another
expression of our “long-term commercial property recovery” theme, where we seek to buy
fundamentally sound real estate that will benefit from gradually improving sentiment. CBL is an
operator of traditional malls, outlet malls, open air shopping centers, and lifestyle properties. CBL
entered bankruptcy during the COVID crisis, shedding debt and reemerging in 2021. There’s no
question that the mall business is not what it used to be, but CBL has done an admirable job in
reducing leverage, investing in its best properties, and returning capital to shareholders. Today,
CBL owns a portfolio of 87 properties and manages 4 others for third parties. The portfolio ranges
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

in quality from “Class A-ish” malls doing $500+ of annual sales per square foot, to challenged
properties in tertiary markets. CBL’s value is concentrated in its best properties, but the lower-
quality properties still produce cash and the company is actively marketing some for sale.
I value CBL shares at $40-45. At $28, CBL trades at an attractive discount to fair value, but I am
also attracted by the low downside risk. The company has almost $9 per share in excess cash
and owns a collection of properties totally unencumbered by debt. These properties produced
$66 million in 2023 cash flow. At 7x cash flow, these properties are worth another $15 per CBL
share. Together with the cash, that’s value of $24 per share before considering any of the debt-
encumbered properties. And there is plenty of value there, too. Some of CBL’s properties are
owned by a holding company that carries a term loan of $730 million. As long as these properties
are worth more than 5.5x cash flow, CBL’s equity in the holding company has value. CBL also has
numerous properties with non-recourse property debt. Some of these properties are not currently
cash-flowing for CBL because their cash flow is insufficient to satisfy their debt service ratios.
These represent pure optionality for CBL. Either things don’t improve and CBL hands the keys to
the lenders, the lenders agree to restructure the debt and the properties become cash-flowing
again, or property performance improves and the debt service issue is resolved. There’s no way
these properties can be actual liabilities for CBL, and plenty of ways they can have value again.
CBL’s best properties are mainly held through joint ventures with other operators. The company is
working to consolidate some of these, and just announced the purchase of its JV partners’ interests
in three malls in Nashville, Kansas City, and St. Louis.
Like our other commercial property holdings, CBL & Associates Properties has its fair share of
challenges. But there are plenty of encouraging signs. CBL’s net operating income was steady from
2023 to 2024, and occupancy ticked higher in the third quarter. The company’s debt burden is very
manageable and shrinking monthly from scheduled amortization and property sales. It’s unlikely
that investors will wake up tomorrow, decide malls are the future of commerce, and bid CBL shares
to $80 or $100. But I do think the combination of strong cash flow, continued debt reduction,
strategic reinvestment in CBL’s best assets, and healthy distributions and share repurchases will
drive shares higher this year and next. Looking back over the years, some of our best investments
have been in companies that were deeply stigmatized and out-of-favor, but had valuable tangible
assets, healthy cash flow, and management capable of maximizing the value of each. CBL certainly
qualifies.
Expert Markets Updates
Alluvial Fund holds a collection of securities that trade on the expert market, the home of securities
whose issuers have ceased providing public financial information. Most brokers do not offer access
to the Expert Market, but the fine folks at Odeon Capital Group LLC execute expert market trades
for us. By necessity, our expert market holdings are long-term in nature: equities I am happy to
hold for many years, or fixed income instruments that offer attractive yields (due to expert market
illiquidity and obscurity, not shaky credit). Our expert market holdings represent 5% of the Alluvial
Fund portfolio and include:
• A preferred share issued by a specialty shipping company. This preferred is
cumulative and yields >13%, with strong asset and cash flow coverage.
• A baby bond issued by an investment management firm. The bond matures in 3
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 8

years and yields 15% to maturity, more than 500 basis points higher than parent
company bonds.
• Cuisine Solutions, a profitable and growing foodtech company. Cuisine Solutions
invented the popular Starbucks Egg Bites and counts Bain Capital among its
investors. I look forward to attending the shareholder meeting next month. See
anyone there?
• A helicopter owner and operator with medical and oil & gas service segments, with
net balance sheet cash and trading at <4x EBITDA. I suspect this company will
eventually IPO or be sold.
• Mechanics Bank of Richmond, a private equity-held bank that will eventually be
sold. As one of California’s largest remaining local banks, Mechanics is a real prize.
And more! Expert market stocks will remain a small part of our overarching strategy due to the
severe liquidity constraints involved, but these securities are remarkably well-valued and I am
happy to hold them for the long run.
Other Updates
Thank you for reading and for the privilege of managing capital on your behalf. Eight years in,
I have never been more excited to wake up each day and resume the hunt for our next great
investment. I’d like to remind everyone that in addition to these quarterly letters and bi-annual
conference calls, I also write about stocks and investing at alluvial.substack.com. If interested,
please sign up for updates.
I hope you and your families are well. As always, I am doing just fine here in beautiful Western
Pennsylvania. I welcome you to reach out with any comments or questions, or just to catch up. I
tend to get lost in my spreadsheets and PDFs, so any reminder that the outside world exists is a
good thing!
The annual audit process will begin soon, as will K-1 preparation. We will, as always, ensure that
K-1s are delivered by mid-March.
I look forward to writing to you again this spring.

The cover image shows a container ship docked at the port of Halifax, in Nova
Scotia, Canada. Halifax is one of the country’s busiest ports thanks to the quality
of its harbor and its proximity to Europe. Logistec Corporation, an Alluvial

I admit to a sense of surprise at our good results thus far in 2023. This is not a market that is
rewarding the shareholders of cash-producing stalwarts. Instead, investors are once again falling
over themselves to buy shares of the same hyper-growth companies that produced such incredible
returns in 2020 and 2021 and such misery last year. I don’t mean real companies like Microsoft and
Alphabet—even at 30 or 40 times cash flows, investors in these dominant and profitable franchises
will likely earn an acceptable return on a long enough timeframe—but companies like C3.ai?
Symbotic? Joby Aviation? Shares of each are up >150% this year. Investors in C3.ai are happily
paying >15x trailing revenue to own the company. Holders of Symbotic are paying >35 times. As
for Joby Aviation, owners are valuing the company at $7 billion despite zero lifetime revenue and
a mere hope that someday the company will have a viable product. And here I am hoping the
market will value some of our companies at better than 6 or times 7 times their sustainable and
growing free cash flow.
While investors seem intent on reliving the experiences of 2020 and 2021, I see no shortage of
bargains in the large cohort of companies that remain tethered to reality. Beneath the several
dozen companies that dominate the financial media and investor attention, there are thousands of
profitable and growing firms that are insufficiently researched. It is in these companies, particularly
in the smallest and least known, that Alluvial Fund has always found its best opportunities.

Portfolio Updates
Little has changed at the top of the portfolio. Our largest holding, P10 Inc., delivered a pleasant
surprise by qualifying for inclusion in the Russell 2000 Index, something that I had thought was at
least another year away. Index inclusion, and the passive investors and fund flows that it brings,
is one of the best ways for small public companies to reduce their cost of capital. I attended the
company shareholder meeting in June and was pleased with management’s strategic vision for the
company. Despite a more challenging fund-raising environment, P10’s asset managers continue
to deliver. P10’s flagship RCP Advisors just
announced it had raised almost $800 million

Unidata SpA continues to integrate its
acquisition of TWT Group, a purchase Unidata S.p.A. 5.7
which will boost profitability by at least 50%
Hammond Power Solutions Inc. 5.5
over the next two years. In my last letter, I
mentioned Unidata’s efforts to qualify for a Rand Worldwide Inc. 5.2
higher tier of the Borsa Italiana, the STAR
Logistec Corp. 4.4
Segment. The application was approved
and Unidata shares debuted on the STAR Supremex Inc. 4.3
Segment in June. The move is consequential,
Fitlife Brands Inc. 3.9
as companies on the STAR segment receive
significantly more investor attention and EACO Corp. 3.6
often, a higher valuation. The company’s
Crawford United Corp. 3.5
other business initiatives, including a
submarine cable linking Sicily with Genoa Total, Top Ten 51.6%
and a new data center, continue to progress.
I rarely write about Rand Worldwide, mostly because there’s not often much new to say. This is a
business that simply performs, and that’s why it is a large holding and will remain so. I sometimes
describe Rand Worldwide as a revenue royalty on the sale of mission critical industry standard
software, and that’s typically a good cash flow stream to own. The good performance continued in
the quarter ended March 31 with revenue up 19% year-over-year and operating income up 35%.
Rand is likely at a short-term revenue and profit peak, as certain of the products it resells are on
multi-year renewal cycles. But shares remain a good value on profits just a year or two away, and
the company will remain a prodigious payer of special dividends. All the more reason to hang on.
In May, I made the short drive up to Cleveland for the Crawford United shareholders meeting.
Crawford United is our Midwestern conglomerate that is building a niche industrial powerhouse.
Since 2017, Crawford’s revenue has increased from $24 million to a run rate of $160 million with
earnings increasing in tandem. While other companies might decamp for a flashy downtown office,
Crawford remains headquartered in a modest brick building in a weedy section of East Cleveland.
Crawford, like many other industrial companies, was pressured in 2021 and 2022 by rising inputs
prices, struggles to obtain essential components, and difficulties with staffing. But thanks to pricing
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

adjustments and the unsnarling of supply chains, Crawford is on pace to record a record year.
The company earned 97 cents per share in the first quarter, $1.07 adjusting for a non-cash loss
on investment and intangibles amortization. Net debt is down to $18 million from $25 million at
the end of 2021. Shares are up sharply this
year, but remain quite cheap at <6x 2023
cash earnings. I enjoyed discussing Crawford’s
acquisition strategy with Chairman Crawford at
the shareholders meeting and I look forward to
seeing what they add to the company’s stable
of profitable manufacturers next.
Our ECIP banks struggled with the rest of the
financial sector in the quarter as pressure from
rising interest rates and concerns about credit
quality lingered. For their part, management
at the banks we hold is minimally concerned
about deposit flight or loan performance. I
very intentionally chose to concentrate in the PHOTO — Crawford United H.Q.
high quality ECIP recipients when building our
bank basket. These banks have a demonstrated history of solid credit performance, healthy capital
ratios, and a rational approach to acquisitions and returning capital. As a group, our holdings trade
at a weighted average price-to-tangible book ratio of 0.65 using the economic value of their ECIP
preferred stock. While all these banks are very cheap on current earnings, we are invested for
what they can do and become in the medium term. The Treasury’s low-cost permanent investment
in each will allow them to nearly double their balance sheets with the increased profit accruing
entirely to common shareholders. The current headwinds will eventually subside and the market
will recognize the earnings potential of each.

Despite its track record of profitability and growth, Logistec struggled in recent years to attract the
market’s attention. Despite nearly doubling its earnings since 2018, its shares would not move. The
company tried various means of highlighting its successes. It initiated quarterly earnings calls and
published an investor presentation for the first time. No luck. The company was simply too small
and its shares too illiquid for the market to capitalize the company properly in the short run. So in
late May, Logistec’s controlling shareholder (a company controlled by the daughters of the founder)
contacted the board of directors to inform the
company it was seeking a means of disposing
of its shares. The company responded by
initiating a sales process.
I believe Logistec shares are worth in excess of
$100 and that the company will achieve a sale
price of at least $90 per share. This would
represent a multiple of 10x 2022 EBITDA and
~9x 2023 EBITDA, accounting for a recent
acquisition and improving results at both
company segments. There is a strong appetite
for port-related assets from infrastructure
investors and pension funds. (Indeed, the
Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec
is a large existing holder of Logistec shares
and is surely kicking the tires.) The presence
of the smaller, less attractive environmental
services business is a complicating factor,
but a separate buyer can no doubt be found IMAGE — Logistec Facility/Terminal Network*
if necessary. While the timeline is uncertain,
I would expect an announcement of some type before year-end. Even if no deal materializes,
downside is limited by Logistec’s modest valuation and the knowledge that the company is for
sale. The fund was an enthusiastic purchaser of Logistec shares in the $50s. I remain very confident
in our investment as shares sit at $65.
Hammond Power Solutions has been one of our best performers this year. The company is
benefitting from a wave of spending on infrastructure build-out and electrification that will
continue for years to come. I added another holding on the same theme this quarter: Preformed
Line Products, a family-controlled Ohio manufacturer of all sorts of products that protect cables,
especially those used in power transmission and communications. With the nation and the
world racing to upgrade power grids and expand broadband internet access, it’s an auspicious
time for the company, and the results show it. This year will be a record one for Preformed Line
Products, but shares remain very reasonably valued. Preformed Line Products has always taken a
cautious approach to its finances, avoiding debt and making measured acquisitions to increase
its capabilities. The company also has extremely substantial owned real estate worth around $300
million in my estimation. Preformed Line Product’s market capitalization is approaching $900
million, but its shares continue to fly under the radar thanks to their low liquidity and the company’s
humble approach.

Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

Our most interesting and unusual addition this quarter comes from the Expert Market, the opaque
and illiquid over-the-counter market to which non-reporting companies were banished following
the SEC rule change of September 2021. The fund is now the proud owner of 12 shares of one
of the market’s highest-priced securities: Mechanics Bank of Richmond, a special situation that
I believe will earn us twice our investment at some point in the next 2-3 years. Mechanics is the
project of legendary bank investor Gerald J. Ford. Mr. Ford began acquiring banks in the 70s and
burnished his reputation in the aftermath of the Savings and Loan Crisis, acquiring many troubled
institutions and ultimately selling at a gigantic profit. Mr. Ford is still active in banking investments,
including through the Ford Financial Funds. In 2015, Ford Financial Fund II acquired a majority
stake in Mechanics, paying $26,832 per share. Under Ford’s control, Mechanics performed a few
smaller acquisitions, then a very large one in 2019, purchasing assets from Rabobank’s North
American subsidiary for $2.1 billion. Mechanics funded the acquisition in part from a rights offering
at $38,000 per share, in which virtually all
the rights were exercised by Ford Financial TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 6/30/23 (%)
Fund II and Ford Financial Fund III. Following
Industrials 22.4
the rights exercise and acquisition, the Ford
Financial entities owned 79% of shares Financials 20.3
outstanding and Rabobank owned 9.9%.
Information Technology 14.4
At year-end 2015, Mechanics had $3.5 Consumer Discretionary 11.2
billion in assets and $353 million in tangible
Communications 10.2
equity capital. Here we stand 8 years later
and the bank has grown into an $18 billion Consumer Staples 8.8

capital. The bank is significantly larger and

Energy 1.6
This is a discount to Ford Financial Fund’s
Health Care 0.8
2015 purchase price and a huge discount
to the rights offering done just 3 years ago. Utilities 0.0
Now, it’s certainly possible that Mechanics
Total 100%
overpaid for the Rabobank assets. It is
also possible that Ford was over-valuing
Mechanics shares in the 2019 rights offering, but I doubt they were far off. We are talking about
a highly sophisticated investor who has seen several banking cycles. I think it’s far more likely
that Mechanics shares are trading well below intrinsic value due to their expert market status and
minimal liquidity.
We are nearing the 10-year mark for Ford Financial Fund II’s investment in Mechanics, during
which Ford Financial has successfully built the bank’s scale and boosted its profitability. At some
point, they will want to exit their investment. Now is not a particularly easy time for banks, so I am
not looking for an IPO or sale announcement soon, but conditions will change. When they do, I
expect Mechanics Bank of Richmond shares to change hands at no less than $40,000 per share
and possibly a good deal more. For now, I am very happy to own shares at 7x earnings and a scant
premium to tangible book value.

Concluding Thoughts
Despite this year’s run-up in global many global markets, I do not think the opportunity set before
us has diminished much if at all. I continue to find value in out of the way places. I have begun
building positions in a post-bankruptcy equity, an old-line materials company trading cheaper than
it has in years, and a liquidating European shipping company, among others. All are too illiquid to
mention at present, but I look forward to discussing each in future letters.
As I write, Alluvial Fund has crossed another important threshold by exceeding $40 million in
assets. Despite this growth, the fund remains able to invest in the tiniest of opportunities. At some
point I will have to close the fund to new capital to preserve this flexibility, but we’re not there yet.
I welcome questions about the portfolio and Alluvial Fund’s strategy. I will host another webinar for
partners in late August. Details will follow.
Thank you for reading and for entrusting your capital to Alluvial Fund. I hope you and your families
are well and I look forward to communicating with you again soon.

Letter to Limited Partners Second Quarter 2023

The cover image shows a container ship docked at the port of Halifax, in Nova
Scotia, Canada. Halifax is one of the country’s busiest ports thanks to the quality
of its harbor and its proximity to Europe. Logistec Corporation, an Alluvial
Fund holding, operates at Halifax in both the Richmond and Ocean terminals,
handling a variety of break-bulk, ro-ro, heavy lift, and project cargos. It also
performs offshore resupply for cruise ships as they increasingly visit Halifax.

Dear Partners,
The second quarter was a strong one for Alluvial Fund. The partnership gained 9.0% compared to
5.3% for the Russell 2000 Index and 4.8% for the Russell Microcap Index. We remain well ahead of
benchmarks year-to-date and since inception.

I admit to a sense of surprise at our good results thus far in 2023. This is not a market that is
rewarding the shareholders of cash-producing stalwarts. Instead, investors are once again falling
over themselves to buy shares of the same hyper-growth companies that produced such incredible
returns in 2020 and 2021 and such misery last year. I don’t mean real companies like Microsoft and
Alphabet—even at 30 or 40 times cash flows, investors in these dominant and profitable franchises
will likely earn an acceptable return on a long enough timeframe—but companies like C3.ai?
Symbotic? Joby Aviation? Shares of each are up >150% this year. Investors in C3.ai are happily
paying >15x trailing revenue to own the company. Holders of Symbotic are paying >35 times. As
for Joby Aviation, owners are valuing the company at $7 billion despite zero lifetime revenue and
a mere hope that someday the company will have a viable product. And here I am hoping the
market will value some of our companies at better than 6 or times 7 times their sustainable and
growing free cash flow.
While investors seem intent on reliving the experiences of 2020 and 2021, I see no shortage of
bargains in the large cohort of companies that remain tethered to reality. Beneath the several
dozen companies that dominate the financial media and investor attention, there are thousands of
profitable and growing firms that are insufficiently researched. It is in these companies, particularly
in the smallest and least known, that Alluvial Fund has always found its best opportunities.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

Portfolio Updates
Little has changed at the top of the portfolio. Our largest holding, P10 Inc., delivered a pleasant
surprise by qualifying for inclusion in the Russell 2000 Index, something that I had thought was at
least another year away. Index inclusion, and the passive investors and fund flows that it brings,
is one of the best ways for small public companies to reduce their cost of capital. I attended the
company shareholder meeting in June and was pleased with management’s strategic vision for the
company. Despite a more challenging fund-raising environment, P10’s asset managers continue
to deliver. P10’s flagship RCP Advisors just
announced it had raised almost $800 million
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 6/30/23 (%)

Unidata SpA continues to integrate its
acquisition of TWT Group, a purchase Unidata S.p.A. 5.7
which will boost profitability by at least 50%
Hammond Power Solutions Inc. 5.5
over the next two years. In my last letter, I
mentioned Unidata’s efforts to qualify for a Rand Worldwide Inc. 5.2
higher tier of the Borsa Italiana, the STAR
Logistec Corp. 4.4
Segment. The application was approved
and Unidata shares debuted on the STAR Supremex Inc. 4.3
Segment in June. The move is consequential,
Fitlife Brands Inc. 3.9
as companies on the STAR segment receive
significantly more investor attention and EACO Corp. 3.6
often, a higher valuation. The company’s
Crawford United Corp. 3.5
other business initiatives, including a
submarine cable linking Sicily with Genoa Total, Top Ten 51.6%
and a new data center, continue to progress.
I rarely write about Rand Worldwide, mostly because there’s not often much new to say. This is a
business that simply performs, and that’s why it is a large holding and will remain so. I sometimes
describe Rand Worldwide as a revenue royalty on the sale of mission critical industry standard
software, and that’s typically a good cash flow stream to own. The good performance continued in
the quarter ended March 31 with revenue up 19% year-over-year and operating income up 35%.
Rand is likely at a short-term revenue and profit peak, as certain of the products it resells are on
multi-year renewal cycles. But shares remain a good value on profits just a year or two away, and
the company will remain a prodigious payer of special dividends. All the more reason to hang on.
In May, I made the short drive up to Cleveland for the Crawford United shareholders meeting.
Crawford United is our Midwestern conglomerate that is building a niche industrial powerhouse.
Since 2017, Crawford’s revenue has increased from $24 million to a run rate of $160 million with
earnings increasing in tandem. While other companies might decamp for a flashy downtown office,
Crawford remains headquartered in a modest brick building in a weedy section of East Cleveland.
Crawford, like many other industrial companies, was pressured in 2021 and 2022 by rising inputs
prices, struggles to obtain essential components, and difficulties with staffing. But thanks to pricing
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

adjustments and the unsnarling of supply chains, Crawford is on pace to record a record year.
The company earned 97 cents per share in the first quarter, $1.07 adjusting for a non-cash loss
on investment and intangibles amortization. Net debt is down to $18 million from $25 million at
the end of 2021. Shares are up sharply this
year, but remain quite cheap at <6x 2023
cash earnings. I enjoyed discussing Crawford’s
acquisition strategy with Chairman Crawford at
the shareholders meeting and I look forward to
seeing what they add to the company’s stable
of profitable manufacturers next.
Our ECIP banks struggled with the rest of the
financial sector in the quarter as pressure from
rising interest rates and concerns about credit
quality lingered. For their part, management
at the banks we hold is minimally concerned
about deposit flight or loan performance. I
very intentionally chose to concentrate in the PHOTO — Crawford United H.Q.
high quality ECIP recipients when building our
bank basket. These banks have a demonstrated history of solid credit performance, healthy capital
ratios, and a rational approach to acquisitions and returning capital. As a group, our holdings trade
at a weighted average price-to-tangible book ratio of 0.65 using the economic value of their ECIP
preferred stock. While all these banks are very cheap on current earnings, we are invested for
what they can do and become in the medium term. The Treasury’s low-cost permanent investment
in each will allow them to nearly double their balance sheets with the increased profit accruing
entirely to common shareholders. The current headwinds will eventually subside and the market
will recognize the earnings potential of each.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the closing price as of the previous month end.

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of March 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.0 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.6 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 9.8 times. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 7% largely due to the addition of one meaningful investment along with additions to recent investment. There were no major sales in the quarter. We continued to increase our position in in Western Capital Resources (expert: WCRS) which we discussed in our 2024 year end letter. Just before the end of the quarter Western Capital announced a tender offer for 666,667 shares or roughly 11% of the company at $15 per share, or a total price of $10 million. The tender price was at a meaningful premium to previous trades. Included in the tender documents were 2024 results. 2024 net income was $6.7 million or $1.12 per share based on yearend share count. If we add back intangible amortization, cash earnings were about $9.1 million, or $1.52 per share based on year end share count. Net cash was nearly $6 per share. The share price rose in the quarter from $9.00 to $15.00 per share. Earnings for 2024 were negatively impacted by their acquisition of Northern Brewer which accounting rules required them to consolidate for the full year. WCRS purchased the business and appears to have relocated it to one of their existing operations to reduce facility and potentially fulfillment costs. In addition to WCRS, we added to Evercel (expert: EVRC) another position we mentioned in our last letter. We spent more time on the issue of whether the shares continue to trade with the rights to its minority investment in ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen protectors, which Evercel contributed to a liquidating trust. We are more convinced that the shares do trade with the rights to proceeds and that the company’s position is incorrect. We expect a binary outcome. We are either wrong and the value will be near zero or we are right and the value will be based on the proceeds from the eventual sale of ZAGG. Shares of Evercel are currently at $0.30 per share just a bit above our average cost basis. Evercel has 27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in 2021 for $200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over 50% equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate about $500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be worth $28 million or just over $1.00 per Evercel share, or four times the price we paid for shares. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been reduced, ZAGG’s value could be higher, which would mean Evercel’s value would be even higher. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 35% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund. Most of the fund’s outperformance in the first quarter was due to the increase in the valuation of our expert market holdings. Our expert market basket of stocks increased in value by 35% in the first quarter, while our “control” positions suffered a modest decline, and our generally undervalued securities increased modestly. At the beginning of the year, Propel, which does not report financial results to shareholders, was valued at $0.603 per share, based on the fund manager’s decision to use a 6% dividend discount model. At quarter end, it was valued at $0.85 per share. That valuation matched the last sales price, as well as management’s 6% dividend discount model based on their April 2 dividend announcement. The most recent bid price was $0.85 per share while ask was $1.00 per share. PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $3.05 per share at the beginning of the year and $2.62 per share at the end of the quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust was valued at last sale, which was $0.26 per unit at year-end and at the end of the first quarter. Fund performance in the quarter also benefitted from MetroCity Bankshares (Nasdaq: MCBS) announcing a merger with First IC. Both are Korean focused banks headquartered in Doraville, Georgia. Under the agreement, First IC shareholders will receive approximately 0.3734 shares of MetroCity and cash of approximately $12.35 per share, or an approximate total value of $22.58 per share. The value First IC shareholders will receive will fluctuate based on changes in MetroCity’s share price. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. First IC was valued at last trade to start the year, which was $9.30 per share. We received a $1 per share dividend in the quarter. At quarter end it was valued at a 20% discount to the expected proceeds, or $20.00 per share. Last trade was $17.25 per share. The current bid as of quarter end was $18.45 per share and ask was $20.55 per share. Half of the fund’s gains in the quarter were due to the increase in First IC. We continue to allocate a meaningful portion of the fund’s portfolio to expert market stocks based on the belief that they will generate satisfactory returns for the fund over time. Update on Propel Media Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15 per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked, we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous 10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In February of this year we received a dividend of just over $0.02 per share, nearly double the dividend of the year ago quarter and the previous quarter. In total we have received nearly $0.076 per share in dividends, or 33% of our purchase price in just over 20 months, and will receive another $0.01 per share in April. The April 2025 dividend is very interesting. The per share amount is twice the May 2024 dividend ($0.01 versus $0.005) yet covers only 52 days versus 94 days. It seems reasonable to assume the improvement in the business as reflected in the increased dividend in February is continuing. Why Propel shortened the timeframe between dividends is a mystery to us. Another interesting data point we track is Propel’s level of borrowing and its loan capacity. Propel’s main business, DeepIntent, has an asset-based loan (ABL) facility with a publicly reporting company, SLR Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each quarter and also their unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed by DeepIntent but also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our understanding that most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s accounts receivable. It seems reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment terms on its accounts receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run rate. It would be the current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to 90% to give us total receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of receivables to 365 days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown in four columns of chart below). estimated annual revenue run rate DeepIntent borrowings from SLR Investment 60 days 60 days 75 days 75 days Date Borrowed Unfunded Total 85% 90% 85% 90% 12/31/22 16,951 3,049 20,000 119,654 113,007 95,723 90,405 03/31/23 16,883 3,117 20,000 119,174 112,553 95,339 90,043 06/30/23 18,075 1,925 20,000 127,588 120,500 102,071 96,400 09/30/23 - - - - - - - 12/31/23 21,067 3,933 25,000 148,708 140,447 118,967 112,357 03/31/24 23,115 6,885 30,000 163,165 154,100 130,532 123,280 06/30/24 25,172 4,828 30,000 177,685 167,813 142,148 134,251 09/30/24 26,527 3,473 30,000 187,249 176,847 149,800 141,477 12/31/24 37,746 7,254 45,000 266,442 251,640 213,154 201,312 Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error. What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150 million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80% from a year earlier (last line of the chart). This would be consistent with the increased dividend (the trailing twelve month dividend has risen 45% in the last year). To say we are eagerly waiting to read SLR’s first quarter filing is an understatement. Update on Our Control Positions By control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased from $15.85 per share to $14.28 per share during the first quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the fund manager owns 2.5% personally. We announced fiscal third quarter results in January. Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share. In the fiscal third quarter, Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least twenty years. Bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two-year order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus $2.2 million the prior year fiscal fourth quarter. Total bookings for the fiscal year were $20.8 million versus $12.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $3.1 million versus $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. For the 2025 fiscal year sales were $13.9 million versus $12.8 million in fiscal 2024. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. The order is believed to include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well, which is reportedly used, or intended to be used, to shoot down hypersonic missiles. Backlog at Solitron was $18.1 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 year (February 28, 2025) versus $11.2 million at the end of the 2024 fiscal year (February 29, 2024). Please see our 2024 yearend letter, for an overview of Solitron’s annual meeting held in January. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.07 per share to $3.20 in the first quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.065 per share versus $0.066 per share in the prior year quarter, although it should be noted that the prior year had minimal income taxes unlike the current year. Pre-tax income increased from $319,000 in the 2023 fourth quarter to $402,000 in the 2024 fourth quarter. The company is debt free and had $1.6 million in cash, or $0.35 per share. In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release noted that PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. PharmChem has no meaningful tariff exposure. Update on Other Fund Holdings Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price decreased from $51.15 per share at the beginning of the year to $51.00 per share at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, they paid a $1.10 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the last two years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Results in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on the same loan that has now been fully reserved. Citizens has not officially released 2024 results although call reports show Q4 2024 results were in line with the prior year. Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price rose during the first quarter from $11.43 per share to $12.00 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of March 2025, AUM was $3.8 billion, an increase of 10% in the first quarter alone. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds. ENDI’s third and fourth quarter operating margins were 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 47 to 48%. Fourth quarter cash earnings were $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of 2024 were approximately $2.50 per share, meaning the stock was trading at just seven times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $19.30 and $23.50 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities affiliated with the fund manager, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. New Position in the Fund During the quarter we built up a new position in the fund, Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK), a community bank in rural Virgina and Tennessee. The bank has 5,557,000 shares outstanding at roughly $12.50 per share for a market cap of $70 million. The bank earned $1.34 per share in 2024 down from $1.74 in 2023. At first glance, things appear to be moving in the wrong direction. That is a big decrease in earnings. In 2024 Skyline acquired a bank in Tennessee. That resulted in merger related expenses, and amortization of core deposit intangibles. In 2023 Skyline earned $12 million before taxes, and $9.7 million after tax. In 2024 it earned $9.3 million before tax and $7.4 million after tax. Skyline incurred $2.5 million in merger related expenses and increased core deposit intangibles. Absent those expenses earnings would have been nearly flat. If we look just at the fourth quarter of 2024, the first full quarter after the acquisition, adjusted pre-tax earnings would have been $4.26 million or $3.41 million after tax, which would be $0.61 per share. Annualized that would come to $2.45 per share. We also think additional cost savings may be possible that did not show up in the first full quarter since the merger. We were able to purchase shares at $12.50 per share, or just over five times earnings. Current dividend yield is a solid 4%. We believe that Skyline should trade closer to ten times earnings, or $25 per share. Change in Fund Administrator The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they planned to close operations as of the end of 2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025. If anyone is not receiving their monthly statements, please let us know. Tax Information and K-1’s Investor K-1’s were issued electronically on April 1. The fund’s annual audit report was sent out on April 15. If any of the fund’s investors did not receive either, please contact us. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2025 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Most of the major indices were hit pretty hard in the first quarter as investors retreated from
the major tech stocks. In the first quarter, the NASDAQ declined 10.4% and the S&P500
(SPY) fell 4.3% largely due to the major tech stocks that hurt the NASDAQ. Other indices we
track declined comparably. Cedar Creek was up 8.7% on the quarter, net of fees and
expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.3%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,204.5%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘25 2024 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 8.7% 5.2% 1,204.5% 14.3%
NASDAQ -10.4% 28.6% 646.6% 11.0%
S&P 500 (SPY) -4.3% 24.9% 524.4% 10.0%
DJIA (DIA) -1.0% 15.2% 492.2% 9.7%
Russell 2000 -9.5% 11.5% 268.8% 7.0%
Russell Microcap -14.4% 13.7% 172.2% 5.4%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,304,476
as of March 31, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $272,159 in the Russell MicroCap
and $746,612 in the NASDAQ.
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.0
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.6 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 9.8 times.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

Weighted price-to-book was 1.5. Dividend yield was 3.4%. Weighted expected return on
equity as of March 31, 2025, was 18.5%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 7% largely due to
the addition of one meaningful investment along with additions to recent investment. There
were no major sales in the quarter.
We continued to increase our position in in Western Capital Resources (expert: WCRS)
which we discussed in our 2024 year end letter. Just before the end of the quarter Western
Capital announced a tender offer for 666,667 shares or roughly 11% of the company at $15
per share, or a total price of $10 million. The tender price was at a meaningful premium to
previous trades. Included in the tender documents were 2024 results. 2024 net income was
$6.7 million or $1.12 per share based on yearend share count. If we add back intangible
amortization, cash earnings were about $9.1 million, or $1.52 per share based on year end
share count. Net cash was nearly $6 per share. The share price rose in the quarter from
$9.00 to $15.00 per share. Earnings for 2024 were negatively impacted by their acquisition
of Northern Brewer which accounting rules required them to consolidate for the full year.
WCRS purchased the business and appears to have relocated it to one of their existing
operations to reduce facility and potentially fulfillment costs.
In addition to WCRS, we added to Evercel (expert: EVRC) another position we mentioned in
our last letter. We spent more time on the issue of whether the shares continue to trade
with the rights to its minority investment in ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen
protectors, which Evercel contributed to a liquidating trust. We are more convinced that the
shares do trade with the rights to proceeds and that the company’s position is incorrect. We
expect a binary outcome. We are either wrong and the value will be near zero or we are
right and the value will be based on the proceeds from the eventual sale of ZAGG.
Shares of Evercel are currently at $0.30 per share just a bit above our average cost basis.
Evercel has 27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in
2021 for $200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over
50% equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate
about $500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be
worth $28 million or just over $1.00 per Evercel share, or four times the price we paid for
shares. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been reduced, ZAGG’s value could be higher,
which would mean Evercel’s value would be even higher.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 35% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not
post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx

Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each
roughly 3% of the fund.
Most of the fund’s outperformance in the first quarter was due to the increase in the valuation
of our expert market holdings. Our expert market basket of stocks increased in value by 35%
in the first quarter, while our “control” positions suffered a modest decline, and our generally
undervalued securities increased modestly.
At the beginning of the year, Propel, which does not report financial results to shareholders,
was valued at $0.603 per share, based on the fund manager’s decision to use a 6% dividend
discount model. At quarter end, it was valued at $0.85 per share. That valuation matched
the last sales price, as well as management’s 6% dividend discount model based on their
April 2 dividend announcement. The most recent bid price was $0.85 per share while ask
was $1.00 per share.
PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $3.05 per share at the beginning of the year and $2.62 per
share at the end of the quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust was valued at last sale, which was
$0.26 per unit at year-end and at the end of the first quarter.
Fund performance in the quarter also benefitted from MetroCity Bankshares (Nasdaq:
MCBS) announcing a merger with First IC. Both are Korean focused banks headquartered in
Doraville, Georgia. Under the agreement, First IC shareholders will receive approximately
0.3734 shares of MetroCity and cash of approximately $12.35 per share, or an approximate
total value of $22.58 per share. The value First IC shareholders will receive will fluctuate
based on changes in MetroCity’s share price. The merger is expected to close in the fourth
quarter of 2025. First IC was valued at last trade to start the year, which was $9.30 per
share. We received a $1 per share dividend in the quarter. At quarter end it was valued at a
20% discount to the expected proceeds, or $20.00 per share.3 Last trade was $17.25 per
share. The current bid as of quarter end was $18.45 per share and ask was $20.55 per
share. Half of the fund’s gains in the quarter were due to the increase in First IC.
We continue to allocate a meaningful portion of the fund’s portfolio to expert market stocks
based on the belief that they will generate satisfactory returns for the fund over time.
Update on Propel Media
Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are
completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there
are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be
acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15
per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and
IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked,
we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in
published reports.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous
10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait.
3 ($22.58 expected proceeds divided by 20% discount to the power of 0.67 to capture the
time element remaining until expected close, or $22.58/((1+20%)^0.67). We chose this
model due to the lack of liquidity in the shares preventing typical arbitrage from taking
place.

Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In February of this
year we received a dividend of just over $0.02 per share, nearly double the dividend of the
year ago quarter and the previous quarter. In total we have received nearly $0.076 per
share in dividends, or 33% of our purchase price in just over 20 months, and will receive
another $0.01 per share in April (see chart below).4
The April 2025 dividend is very interesting. The
per share amount is twice the May 2024 dividend
($0.01 versus $0.005) yet covers only 52 days
versus 94 days. It seems reasonable to assume
the improvement in the business as reflected in
the increased dividend in February is continuing.
Why Propel shortened the timeframe between
dividends is a mystery to us.
Another interesting data point we track is
Propel’s level of borrowing and its loan capacity.
Propel’s main business, DeepIntent, has an
asset-based loan (ABL) facility with a publicly
reporting company, SLR Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each
quarter and also their unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed
by DeepIntent but also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our
understanding that most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s
accounts receivable. It seems reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment
terms on its accounts receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run
rate. It would be the current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to
90% to give us total receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of
receivables to 365 days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown
in four columns of chart below).

Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error.
What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end
of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150
million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue
run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80%
from a year earlier (last line of the chart). This would be consistent with the increased
dividend (the trailing twelve month dividend has risen 45% in the last year). To say we are
eagerly waiting to read SLR’s first quarter filing is an understatement.
4 We believe the dividends are due to net income since they are reported as dividends and not return of capital.

Update on Our Control Positions
By control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly
influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron
and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all
companies.
Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased from $15.85 per share to
$14.28 per share during the first quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a
board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the
fund manager owns 2.5% personally. We announced fiscal third quarter results in January.
Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share.
In the fiscal third quarter, Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least
twenty years. Bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million.
Bookings included a large two-year order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System)
components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth
quarter, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus $2.2
million the prior year fiscal fourth quarter. Total bookings for the fiscal year were $20.8
million versus $12.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were
$3.1 million versus $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. For the 2025 fiscal year sales were
$13.9 million versus $12.8 million in fiscal 2024. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included
over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for
AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. The order is believed to
include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well, which is reportedly
used, or intended to be used, to shoot down hypersonic missiles.
Backlog at Solitron was $18.1 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 year (February 28,
2025) versus $11.2 million at the end of the 2024 fiscal year (February 29, 2024). Please
see our 2024 yearend letter, for an overview of Solitron’s annual meeting held in January.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares,
and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.07 per
share to $3.20 in the first quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect
drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.065
per share versus $0.066 per share in the prior year quarter, although it should be noted that
the prior year had minimal income taxes unlike the current year. Pre-tax income increased
from $319,000 in the 2023 fourth quarter to $402,000 in the 2024 fourth quarter. The
company is debt free and had $1.6 million in cash, or $0.35 per share.
In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release
noted that PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of
the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. PharmChem has no meaningful
tariff exposure.
Update on Other Fund Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7
million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program
(ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price decreased from $51.15 per share at the
beginning of the year to $51.00 per share at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter,
they paid a $1.10 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the
last two years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine
months of 2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of

2023. Results in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on
the same loan that has now been fully reserved. Citizens has not officially released 2024
results although call reports show Q4 2024 results were in line with the prior year.
Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized
earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an
incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is
shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic
growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share
repurchases.
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price
rose during the first quarter from $11.43 per share to $12.00 per share. ENDI owns
CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed
accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from
$2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term
High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end
of March 2025, AUM was $3.8 billion, an increase of 10% in the first quarter alone. We think
the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds.
ENDI’s third and fourth quarter operating margins were 32% but that is misleading. ENDI
incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other
investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 47 to 48%. Fourth
quarter cash earnings were $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per share annualized.5 Net cash and
investments at the end of 2024 were approximately $2.50 per share, meaning the stock was
trading at just seven times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in
our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times
cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run
rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $19.30 and $23.50 per
share.6
Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in
exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other
entities affiliated with the fund manager, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-
win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional capital to good capital
allocators to grow assets under management.
New Position in the Fund
During the quarter we built up a new position in the fund, Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK),
a community bank in rural Virgina and Tennessee. The bank has 5,557,000 shares
outstanding at roughly $12.50 per share for a market cap of $70 million. The bank earned
5 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.
6 A slight discount might be needed to account for outstanding warrants.

$1.34 per share in 2024 down from $1.74 in 2023. At first glance, things appear to be
moving in the wrong direction. That is a big decrease in earnings. In 2024 Skyline acquired
a bank in Tennessee. That resulted in merger related expenses, and amortization of core
deposit intangibles.
In 2023 Skyline earned $12 million before taxes, and $9.7 million after tax. In 2024 it earned
$9.3 million before tax and $7.4 million after tax. Skyline incurred $2.5 million in merger
related expenses and increased core deposit intangibles. Absent those expenses earnings
would have been nearly flat. If we look just at the fourth quarter of 2024, the first full quarter
after the acquisition, adjusted pre-tax earnings would have been $4.26 million or $3.41
million after tax, which would be $0.61 per share. Annualized that would come to $2.45 per
share. We also think additional cost savings may be possible that did not show up in the first
full quarter since the merger. We were able to purchase shares at $12.50 per share, or just
over five times earnings. Current dividend yield is a solid 4%. We believe that Skyline should
trade closer to ten times earnings, or $25 per share.
Change in Fund Administrator
The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they planned to close operations as of the end
of 2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025.
If anyone is not receiving their monthly statements, please let us know.
Tax Information and K-1’s

existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices

In the first quarter, the NASDAQ declined 10.4% and the S&P500 (SPY) fell 4.3% largely due to the major tech stocks that hurt the NASDAQ. Other indices we track declined comparably. Cedar Creek was up 8.7% on the quarter, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.3%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,204.5%, net of fees and expenses. Q1 ‘25 2024 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 8.7% 5.2% 1,204.5% 14.3% NASDAQ -10.4% 28.6% 646.6% 11.0% S&P 500 (SPY) -4.3% 24.9% 524.4% 10.0% DJIA (DIA) -1.0% 15.2% 492.2% 9.7% Russell 2000 -9.5% 11.5% 268.8% 7.0% Russell Microcap -14.4% 13.7% 172.2% 5.4% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,304,476 as of March 31, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $272,159 in the Russell MicroCap and $746,612 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of March 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.0 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.6 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 9.8 times. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 7% largely due to the addition of one meaningful investment along with additions to recent investment. There were no major sales in the quarter. We continued to increase our position in in Western Capital Resources (expert: WCRS) which we discussed in our 2024 year end letter. Just before the end of the quarter Western Capital announced a tender offer for 666,667 shares or roughly 11% of the company at $15 per share, or a total price of $10 million. The tender price was at a meaningful premium to previous trades. Included in the tender documents were 2024 results. 2024 net income was $6.7 million or $1.12 per share based on yearend share count. If we add back intangible amortization, cash earnings were about $9.1 million, or $1.52 per share based on year end share count. Net cash was nearly $6 per share. The share price rose in the quarter from $9.00 to $15.00 per share. Earnings for 2024 were negatively impacted by their acquisition of Northern Brewer which accounting rules required them to consolidate for the full year. WCRS purchased the business and appears to have relocated it to one of their existing operations to reduce facility and potentially fulfillment costs. In addition to WCRS, we added to Evercel (expert: EVRC) another position we mentioned in our last letter. We spent more time on the issue of whether the shares continue to trade with the rights to its minority investment in ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen protectors, which Evercel contributed to a liquidating trust. We are more convinced that the shares do trade with the rights to proceeds and that the company’s position is incorrect. We expect a binary outcome. We are either wrong and the value will be near zero or we are right and the value will be based on the proceeds from the eventual sale of ZAGG. Shares of Evercel are currently at $0.30 per share just a bit above our average cost basis. Evercel has 27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in 2021 for $200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over 50% equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate about $500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be worth $28 million or just over $1.00 per Evercel share, or four times the price we paid for shares. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been reduced, ZAGG’s value could be higher, which would mean Evercel’s value would be even higher. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 35% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund. Most of the fund’s outperformance in the first quarter was due to the increase in the valuation of our expert market holdings. Our expert market basket of stocks increased in value by 35% in the first quarter, while our “control” positions suffered a modest decline, and our generally undervalued securities increased modestly. At the beginning of the year, Propel, which does not report financial results to shareholders, was valued at $0.603 per share, based on the fund manager’s decision to use a 6% dividend discount model. At quarter end, it was valued at $0.85 per share. That valuation matched the last sales price, as well as management’s 6% dividend discount model based on their April 2 dividend announcement. The most recent bid price was $0.85 per share while ask was $1.00 per share. PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $3.05 per share at the beginning of the year and $2.62 per share at the end of the quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust was valued at last sale, which was $0.26 per unit at year-end and at the end of the first quarter. Fund performance in the quarter also benefitted from MetroCity Bankshares (Nasdaq: MCBS) announcing a merger with First IC. Both are Korean focused banks headquartered in Doraville, Georgia. Under the agreement, First IC shareholders will receive approximately 0.3734 shares of MetroCity and cash of approximately $12.35 per share, or an approximate total value of $22.58 per share. The value First IC shareholders will receive will fluctuate based on changes in MetroCity’s share price. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. First IC was valued at last trade to start the year, which was $9.30 per share. We received a $1 per share dividend in the quarter. At quarter end it was valued at a 20% discount to the expected proceeds, or $20.00 per share. Last trade was $17.25 per share. The current bid as of quarter end was $18.45 per share and ask was $20.55 per share. Half of the fund’s gains in the quarter were due to the increase in First IC. We continue to allocate a meaningful portion of the fund’s portfolio to expert market stocks based on the belief that they will generate satisfactory returns for the fund over time. Update on Propel Media Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15 per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked, we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous 10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In February of this year we received a dividend of just over $0.02 per share, nearly double the dividend of the year ago quarter and the previous quarter. In total we have received nearly $0.076 per share in dividends, or 33% of our purchase price in just over 20 months, and will receive another $0.01 per share in April. The April 2025 dividend is very interesting. The per share amount is twice the May 2024 dividend ($0.01 versus $0.005) yet covers only 52 days versus 94 days. It seems reasonable to assume the improvement in the business as reflected in the increased dividend in February is continuing. Why Propel shortened the timeframe between dividends is a mystery to us. Another interesting data point we track is Propel’s level of borrowing and its loan capacity. Propel’s main business, DeepIntent, has an asset-based loan (ABL) facility with a publicly reporting company, SLR Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each quarter and also their unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed by DeepIntent but also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our understanding that most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s accounts receivable. It seems reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment terms on its accounts receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run rate. It would be the current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to 90% to give us total receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of receivables to 365 days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown in four columns of chart below). estimated annual revenue run rate DeepIntent borrowings from SLR Investment 60 days 60 days 75 days 75 days Date Borrowed Unfunded Total 85% 90% 85% 90% 12/31/22 16,951 3,049 20,000 119,654 113,007 95,723 90,405 03/31/23 16,883 3,117 20,000 119,174 112,553 95,339 90,043 06/30/23 18,075 1,925 20,000 127,588 120,500 102,071 96,400 09/30/23 - - - - - - - 12/31/23 21,067 3,933 25,000 148,708 140,447 118,967 112,357 03/31/24 23,115 6,885 30,000 163,165 154,100 130,532 123,280 06/30/24 25,172 4,828 30,000 177,685 167,813 142,148 134,251 09/30/24 26,527 3,473 30,000 187,249 176,847 149,800 141,477 12/31/24 37,746 7,254 45,000 266,442 251,640 213,154 201,312 Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error. What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150 million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80% from a year earlier (last line of the chart). This would be consistent with the increased dividend (the trailing twelve month dividend has risen 45% in the last year). To say we are eagerly waiting to read SLR’s first quarter filing is an understatement. Update on Our Control Positions By control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased from $15.85 per share to $14.28 per share during the first quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the fund manager owns 2.5% personally. We announced fiscal third quarter results in January. Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share. In the fiscal third quarter, Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least twenty years. Bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two-year order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus $2.2 million the prior year fiscal fourth quarter. Total bookings for the fiscal year were $20.8 million versus $12.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $3.1 million versus $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. For the 2025 fiscal year sales were $13.9 million versus $12.8 million in fiscal 2024. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. The order is believed to include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well, which is reportedly used, or intended to be used, to shoot down hypersonic missiles. Backlog at Solitron was $18.1 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 year (February 28, 2025) versus $11.2 million at the end of the 2024 fiscal year (February 29, 2024). Please see our 2024 yearend letter, for an overview of Solitron’s annual meeting held in January. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.07 per share to $3.20 in the first quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.065 per share versus $0.066 per share in the prior year quarter, although it should be noted that the prior year had minimal income taxes unlike the current year. Pre-tax income increased from $319,000 in the 2023 fourth quarter to $402,000 in the 2024 fourth quarter. The company is debt free and had $1.6 million in cash, or $0.35 per share. In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release noted that PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. PharmChem has no meaningful tariff exposure. Update on Other Fund Holdings Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price decreased from $51.15 per share at the beginning of the year to $51.00 per share at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, they paid a $1.10 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the last two years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Results in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on the same loan that has now been fully reserved. Citizens has not officially released 2024 results although call reports show Q4 2024 results were in line with the prior year. Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price rose during the first quarter from $11.43 per share to $12.00 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of March 2025, AUM was $3.8 billion, an increase of 10% in the first quarter alone. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds. ENDI’s third and fourth quarter operating margins were 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 47 to 48%. Fourth quarter cash earnings were $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of 2024 were approximately $2.50 per share, meaning the stock was trading at just seven times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $19.30 and $23.50 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities affiliated with the fund manager, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. New Position in the Fund During the quarter we built up a new position in the fund, Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK), a community bank in rural Virgina and Tennessee. The bank has 5,557,000 shares outstanding at roughly $12.50 per share for a market cap of $70 million. The bank earned $1.34 per share in 2024 down from $1.74 in 2023. At first glance, things appear to be moving in the wrong direction. That is a big decrease in earnings. In 2024 Skyline acquired a bank in Tennessee. That resulted in merger related expenses, and amortization of core deposit intangibles. In 2023 Skyline earned $12 million before taxes, and $9.7 million after tax. In 2024 it earned $9.3 million before tax and $7.4 million after tax. Skyline incurred $2.5 million in merger related expenses and increased core deposit intangibles. Absent those expenses earnings would have been nearly flat. If we look just at the fourth quarter of 2024, the first full quarter after the acquisition, adjusted pre-tax earnings would have been $4.26 million or $3.41 million after tax, which would be $0.61 per share. Annualized that would come to $2.45 per share. We also think additional cost savings may be possible that did not show up in the first full quarter since the merger. We were able to purchase shares at $12.50 per share, or just over five times earnings. Current dividend yield is a solid 4%. We believe that Skyline should trade closer to ten times earnings, or $25 per share. Change in Fund Administrator The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they planned to close operations as of the end of 2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025. If anyone is not receiving their monthly statements, please let us know. Tax Information and K-1’s Investor K-1’s were issued electronically on April 1. The fund’s annual audit report was sent out on April 15. If any of the fund’s investors did not receive either, please contact us. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2025 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Most of the major indices were hit pretty hard in the first quarter as investors retreated from
the major tech stocks. In the first quarter, the NASDAQ declined 10.4% and the S&P500
(SPY) fell 4.3% largely due to the major tech stocks that hurt the NASDAQ. Other indices we
track declined comparably. Cedar Creek was up 8.7% on the quarter, net of fees and
expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.3%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,204.5%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘25 2024 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 8.7% 5.2% 1,204.5% 14.3%
NASDAQ -10.4% 28.6% 646.6% 11.0%
S&P 500 (SPY) -4.3% 24.9% 524.4% 10.0%
DJIA (DIA) -1.0% 15.2% 492.2% 9.7%
Russell 2000 -9.5% 11.5% 268.8% 7.0%
Russell Microcap -14.4% 13.7% 172.2% 5.4%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,304,476
as of March 31, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $272,159 in the Russell MicroCap
and $746,612 in the NASDAQ.
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.0
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.6 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 9.8 times.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

Weighted price-to-book was 1.5. Dividend yield was 3.4%. Weighted expected return on
equity as of March 31, 2025, was 18.5%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 7% largely due to
the addition of one meaningful investment along with additions to recent investment. There
were no major sales in the quarter.
We continued to increase our position in in Western Capital Resources (expert: WCRS)
which we discussed in our 2024 year end letter. Just before the end of the quarter Western
Capital announced a tender offer for 666,667 shares or roughly 11% of the company at $15
per share, or a total price of $10 million. The tender price was at a meaningful premium to
previous trades. Included in the tender documents were 2024 results. 2024 net income was
$6.7 million or $1.12 per share based on yearend share count. If we add back intangible
amortization, cash earnings were about $9.1 million, or $1.52 per share based on year end
share count. Net cash was nearly $6 per share. The share price rose in the quarter from
$9.00 to $15.00 per share. Earnings for 2024 were negatively impacted by their acquisition
of Northern Brewer which accounting rules required them to consolidate for the full year.
WCRS purchased the business and appears to have relocated it to one of their existing
operations to reduce facility and potentially fulfillment costs.
In addition to WCRS, we added to Evercel (expert: EVRC) another position we mentioned in
our last letter. We spent more time on the issue of whether the shares continue to trade
with the rights to its minority investment in ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen
protectors, which Evercel contributed to a liquidating trust. We are more convinced that the
shares do trade with the rights to proceeds and that the company’s position is incorrect. We
expect a binary outcome. We are either wrong and the value will be near zero or we are
right and the value will be based on the proceeds from the eventual sale of ZAGG.
Shares of Evercel are currently at $0.30 per share just a bit above our average cost basis.
Evercel has 27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in
2021 for $200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over
50% equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate
about $500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be
worth $28 million or just over $1.00 per Evercel share, or four times the price we paid for
shares. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been reduced, ZAGG’s value could be higher,
which would mean Evercel’s value would be even higher.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 35% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not
post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx

Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each
roughly 3% of the fund.
Most of the fund’s outperformance in the first quarter was due to the increase in the valuation
of our expert market holdings. Our expert market basket of stocks increased in value by 35%
in the first quarter, while our “control” positions suffered a modest decline, and our generally
undervalued securities increased modestly.
At the beginning of the year, Propel, which does not report financial results to shareholders,
was valued at $0.603 per share, based on the fund manager’s decision to use a 6% dividend
discount model. At quarter end, it was valued at $0.85 per share. That valuation matched
the last sales price, as well as management’s 6% dividend discount model based on their
April 2 dividend announcement. The most recent bid price was $0.85 per share while ask
was $1.00 per share.
PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $3.05 per share at the beginning of the year and $2.62 per
share at the end of the quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust was valued at last sale, which was
$0.26 per unit at year-end and at the end of the first quarter.
Fund performance in the quarter also benefitted from MetroCity Bankshares (Nasdaq:
MCBS) announcing a merger with First IC. Both are Korean focused banks headquartered in
Doraville, Georgia. Under the agreement, First IC shareholders will receive approximately
0.3734 shares of MetroCity and cash of approximately $12.35 per share, or an approximate
total value of $22.58 per share. The value First IC shareholders will receive will fluctuate
based on changes in MetroCity’s share price. The merger is expected to close in the fourth
quarter of 2025. First IC was valued at last trade to start the year, which was $9.30 per
share. We received a $1 per share dividend in the quarter. At quarter end it was valued at a
20% discount to the expected proceeds, or $20.00 per share.3 Last trade was $17.25 per
share. The current bid as of quarter end was $18.45 per share and ask was $20.55 per
share. Half of the fund’s gains in the quarter were due to the increase in First IC.
We continue to allocate a meaningful portion of the fund’s portfolio to expert market stocks
based on the belief that they will generate satisfactory returns for the fund over time.
Update on Propel Media
Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are
completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there
are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be
acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15
per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and
IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked,
we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in
published reports.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous
10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait.
3 ($22.58 expected proceeds divided by 20% discount to the power of 0.67 to capture the
time element remaining until expected close, or $22.58/((1+20%)^0.67). We chose this
model due to the lack of liquidity in the shares preventing typical arbitrage from taking
place.

Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In February of this
year we received a dividend of just over $0.02 per share, nearly double the dividend of the
year ago quarter and the previous quarter. In total we have received nearly $0.076 per
share in dividends, or 33% of our purchase price in just over 20 months, and will receive
another $0.01 per share in April (see chart below).4
The April 2025 dividend is very interesting. The
per share amount is twice the May 2024 dividend
($0.01 versus $0.005) yet covers only 52 days
versus 94 days. It seems reasonable to assume
the improvement in the business as reflected in
the increased dividend in February is continuing.
Why Propel shortened the timeframe between
dividends is a mystery to us.
Another interesting data point we track is
Propel’s level of borrowing and its loan capacity.
Propel’s main business, DeepIntent, has an
asset-based loan (ABL) facility with a publicly
reporting company, SLR Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each
quarter and also their unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed
by DeepIntent but also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our
understanding that most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s
accounts receivable. It seems reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment
terms on its accounts receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run
rate. It would be the current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to
90% to give us total receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of
receivables to 365 days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown
in four columns of chart below).

Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error.
What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end
of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150
million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue
run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80%
from a year earlier (last line of the chart). This would be consistent with the increased
dividend (the trailing twelve month dividend has risen 45% in the last year). To say we are
eagerly waiting to read SLR’s first quarter filing is an understatement.
4 We believe the dividends are due to net income since they are reported as dividends and not return of capital.

Update on Our Control Positions
By control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly
influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron
and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all
companies.
Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased from $15.85 per share to
$14.28 per share during the first quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a
board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the
fund manager owns 2.5% personally. We announced fiscal third quarter results in January.
Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share.
In the fiscal third quarter, Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least
twenty years. Bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million.
Bookings included a large two-year order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System)
components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth
quarter, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus $2.2
million the prior year fiscal fourth quarter. Total bookings for the fiscal year were $20.8
million versus $12.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were
$3.1 million versus $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. For the 2025 fiscal year sales were
$13.9 million versus $12.8 million in fiscal 2024. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included
over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for
AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. The order is believed to
include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well, which is reportedly
used, or intended to be used, to shoot down hypersonic missiles.
Backlog at Solitron was $18.1 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 year (February 28,
2025) versus $11.2 million at the end of the 2024 fiscal year (February 29, 2024). Please
see our 2024 yearend letter, for an overview of Solitron’s annual meeting held in January.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares,
and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.07 per
share to $3.20 in the first quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect
drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.065
per share versus $0.066 per share in the prior year quarter, although it should be noted that
the prior year had minimal income taxes unlike the current year. Pre-tax income increased
from $319,000 in the 2023 fourth quarter to $402,000 in the 2024 fourth quarter. The
company is debt free and had $1.6 million in cash, or $0.35 per share.
In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release
noted that PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of
the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. PharmChem has no meaningful
tariff exposure.
Update on Other Fund Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7
million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program
(ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price decreased from $51.15 per share at the
beginning of the year to $51.00 per share at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter,
they paid a $1.10 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the
last two years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine
months of 2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of

2023. Results in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on
the same loan that has now been fully reserved. Citizens has not officially released 2024
results although call reports show Q4 2024 results were in line with the prior year.
Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized
earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an
incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is
shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic
growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share
repurchases.
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price
rose during the first quarter from $11.43 per share to $12.00 per share. ENDI owns
CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed
accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from
$2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term
High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end
of March 2025, AUM was $3.8 billion, an increase of 10% in the first quarter alone. We think
the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds.
ENDI’s third and fourth quarter operating margins were 32% but that is misleading. ENDI
incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other
investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 47 to 48%. Fourth
quarter cash earnings were $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per share annualized.5 Net cash and
investments at the end of 2024 were approximately $2.50 per share, meaning the stock was
trading at just seven times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in
our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times
cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run
rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $19.30 and $23.50 per
share.6
Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in
exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other
entities affiliated with the fund manager, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-
win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional capital to good capital
allocators to grow assets under management.
New Position in the Fund
During the quarter we built up a new position in the fund, Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK),
a community bank in rural Virgina and Tennessee. The bank has 5,557,000 shares
outstanding at roughly $12.50 per share for a market cap of $70 million. The bank earned
5 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.
6 A slight discount might be needed to account for outstanding warrants.

$1.34 per share in 2024 down from $1.74 in 2023. At first glance, things appear to be
moving in the wrong direction. That is a big decrease in earnings. In 2024 Skyline acquired
a bank in Tennessee. That resulted in merger related expenses, and amortization of core
deposit intangibles.
In 2023 Skyline earned $12 million before taxes, and $9.7 million after tax. In 2024 it earned
$9.3 million before tax and $7.4 million after tax. Skyline incurred $2.5 million in merger
related expenses and increased core deposit intangibles. Absent those expenses earnings
would have been nearly flat. If we look just at the fourth quarter of 2024, the first full quarter
after the acquisition, adjusted pre-tax earnings would have been $4.26 million or $3.41
million after tax, which would be $0.61 per share. Annualized that would come to $2.45 per
share. We also think additional cost savings may be possible that did not show up in the first
full quarter since the merger. We were able to purchase shares at $12.50 per share, or just
over five times earnings. Current dividend yield is a solid 4%. We believe that Skyline should
trade closer to ten times earnings, or $25 per share.
Change in Fund Administrator

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

For the year, the NASDAQ rose 28.6% and the S&P500 (SPY) rose 24.9%. Other indices we track posted double-digit returns. Cedar Creek was up 5.2% on the year, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. While we fell short of the major indices in 2024 we like the way the portfolio is constructed and believe we can generate solid returns in the coming years. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,099.8%, net of fees and expenses. Q4 ‘24 2024 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 0.4% 5.2% 1,099.8% 14.0% NASDAQ 6.2% 28.6% 733.4% 11.8% S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 24.9% 552.5% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 0.9% 15.2% 497.8% 9.9% Russell 2000 0.3% 11.5% 307.4% 7.7% Russell Microcap 5.9% 13.7% 217.9% 6.3% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,199,796 as of December 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $317,893 in the Russell MicroCap and $833,425 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of December 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.2 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.0 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.4. Dividend yield was 3.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 18.5%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 8% largely due to new money coming into the fund and a couple of holdings being acquired. There were no major sales in the quarter. We re-entered Evercel (expert: EVRC) after the Company strangely announced that any shares sold after February 26, 2024 do not include the rights to its minority investment in ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen protectors, which Evercel contributed to a liquidating trust. This is unlikely to be true in our opinion since there is no evidence that the transfer was reported to FINRA, no related security was issued, and trading was not halted. In those cases, the security typically trades with all rights attached. We decided to purchase shares after they plummeted for two reasons: 1. because in our opinion, we saw a great risk/reward opportunity believing the shares are trading with full rights to potential ZAGG proceeds, and 2. since we had previously sold some shares after February 26, 2024 that were held on February 26, 2024, we were effectively “hedged” on some of the shares we bought. Shares are currently at $0.26 per share just a bit above our average cost basis. Evercel has 27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in 2021 for $200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over 50% equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate about $500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be worth $28 million or four times the price we paid. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been reduced, its value could be higher. We also re-entered two old favorites Pardee Resources (otc: PDER) and Western Capital Resources (expert: WCRS). Pardee Resources is a natural resources company with royalty interests in coal, natural gas, timber and agriculture. Market cap is $200 million. Pardee paid a $25 per share special year-end dividend in December and announced in October that it was putting 47,000 acres of its timberland portfolio for sale. The purpose was to rebalance its resource portfolio. The year-end special dividend is becoming regular. Pardee paid $15 per share in 2021, $20 per share in 2022, $15 per share in 2023 and $25 per share in 2024. The regular dividend is $1.80 per quarter. We estimate Pardee still has over $40 per share in cash at year end. Trailing EBITDA per share is over $41. Most recent share price was $310 per share. Western Capital is a holding company whose primary holdings include 270 Cricket wireless stores, Jackson & Perkins, a retailer of roses, plants and seed, and three ice rinks in Michigan. It has significantly reduced its share count over the last year and a half. By usings its cash to buy 255,564 shares from individuals at $4.58 per share average, and, more importantly, by purchasing interests in two WCR Investment LLC’s which own approximately 63% of the company’s shares it has effectively reduced its share count from 9.1 million to 6.0 million. Date Cost Purchased effective # shares per share Jun-23 $ 7,081,422 36.3% WCR Investment LLCs 2,023,263 $ 3.50 in 2024 $ 1,170,000 common stock 255,564 $ 4.58 Mar-24 $ 3,495,157 14.75% WCR Investment LLCs 822,390 $ 4.25 Total $11,746,579 3,101,217 $ 3.79 Earnings for WCRS in 2022 were $10.2 million and in 2023 were $10.6 million. Reported earnings are understated due to intangible amortization which was $2.0 million in 2022 and $2.4 million in 2023. Thus, cash earnings were $12.2 million and $13.0 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In the first half of 2024, which is their stronger half, earnings were $7.2 million, or $1.20 per share. Cash earnings were $8.4 million, or $1.40 per share. Book value as of June 30, 2024, was $90.4 million, or $15.07 per share. Net cash was $39.9 million, or $6.65 per share. The company continues to look for acquisitions at 4-6 times EBITDA. Last trade on the expert market was $9 per share. We were the happy buyers. Where else are we going to be able to buy shares in a company for one times earnings, net of cash, in company that has reduced its share count by nearly 35% in the last eighteen months? Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 31% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 75% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 10% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 5%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 4% of the fund. Most of the fund’s underperformance this year was due to the decline in the valuation of our expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89 per share. At year end, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.603 per share. PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $7 per share at the beginning of the year and $3.05 per share at the end of the year. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit and was valued at $0.26 per unit as of year-end. First IC performed well. It increased from $6.50 per share to $9.30 per share during the year and paid a $1 per share dividend. Despite the poor performance from our major expert stocks in 2024 we believe they will generate satisfactory returns for the fund over time. Update on Our Control Positions We decided to break out our control positions from other positions in the fund. By control, we mean that I am on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that I have total control and get what I want. Both companies have strong boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.25 per share to $15.85 per share during the year. As a reminder, I am CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares. I own about 2.5% personally. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were just $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. We announced fiscal third quarter results in January. Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share. Both quarters were negatively impacted by lower revenues due to decreased backlog at the beginning of the year. That is rapidly changing. Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least twenty years. Bookings were $8 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two year order from L3Harris for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) – our second largest defense program. We have been told to expect a $5 million order from our largest defense program, AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) for RTX (formerly Raytheon) in the current quarter. The order is expected to include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well. At Solitron’s annual meeting in January I made detailed comments regarding our largest customers. HIMARS launcher vehicle production capacity increased from 48 to 96 in 2024 (see picture). They are running at maximum capacity. Demand exceeds production based on its success in Ukraine. While we do not know for certain, we suspect our parts are used in launcher kits and not the launch vehicles. It has been reported that AMRAAM production has been increased to 1,200 missiles annually. This is a 50% increase in just over two years. Foreign governments have ordered, or requested to order, over 3,300 AMRAAM in the past 12-15 months. Solitron management expects both programs to run at maximum capacity for a while. It is still unknown what will happen with the US stockpile program that was part of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. The purpose was to replenish US stockpiles. A number of programs were included. HIMARS, AMRAAM, and SM-6 were the major ones Solitron supplies parts to. The Act approved 700 additional HIMARS launchers, 5,100 AMRAAMs, and 1,500 SM-6 missiles. In our minds it is impossible for the US government to replenish stockpiles based on current production levels and foreign demand. For HIMARS it would take more than seven years of full production to complete replenishment, but that would mean allocating nothing to current US and foreign demand. For AMRAAM it would take over four years of production. For SM-6, it would take over ten years based on reported production levels of 125 missiles per year. If the government is serious about replenishing stockpiles it would seem to require production levels for all three programs to be increased from current levels. The problem is we just don’t know if the government will follow through on the replenishment or not; regardless, all three programs have strong tail winds. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $2.56 per share to $3.07 in 2024. PharmChem also paid a $0.25 per share dividend in the fourth quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Third quarter earnings were $0.076 per share. The company is debt free and had $2.5 million in cash, or $0.53 per share before paying the dividend. In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. There have been numerous comments in the public sphere by HHS Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Vice President Vance pushing for a focus shift toward increased monitoring and prevention versus the previous administration. This could be beneficial to PharmChem’s sales. Update on Other Top Holdings Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $37.70 per share at the beginning of the year to $51.15 per share at the end of the year. In addition, they paid a $1.00 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the last two years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Results in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on the same loan that has now been fully reserved. Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Propel Media (expert: PROM) – in January of 2024 the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In total we have received over $0.055 per share in dividends, or 24% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in February. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts). With a new administration having come into power, it is likely that significant changes will occur at the FTC. Whether the parties will revisit their merger is unknown, but we do expect to see a more business-friendly FTC over the next four years. ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price rose during 2024 from $4.02 per share to $11.43 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website as of the end of January 2025, AUM was $3.5 billion. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund, which has raised over $30 million in its first four months. ENDI’s third quarter operating margin was 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 48%. Assuming similar adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.32 per share, or $1.30 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of 2024 should be approximately $2.25 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just seven to eight times earnings, net of cash. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in our 2024 first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew AUM 30% in 2024! If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $12.60 to $15.25 per share today with that value increasing $0.35 per share every quarter due to earnings. But that would be absurd. In hindsight we were way too conservative using an 8-10 times earnings plus net cash valuation. We may still be too conservative, but using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $17.85 and $21.75 per share. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 at the end of 2023 to $0.26 per unit at the end of 2024. We covered the trust in great detail in our third quarter letter. We think the Trustee is making a number of mistakes that are harming unitholders. We have continued to add to our position throughout the year. Change in Fund Administrator The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of the end of 2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Sincerely, Tim Eriksen Manager Cedar Creek Partners LLC tim@eriksencapitalmgmt.com (please note this is a new email address) (360) 354-3331 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.","Managing Member – Tim Eriksen Eriksen Capital Management, LLC 8695 Glendale Road, Custer, WA 98240

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Stock markets in 2024 continued to be led by the NASDAQ and a few major tech stocks. For
the year, the NASDAQ rose 28.6% and the S&P500 (SPY) rose 24.9%. Other indices we track
posted double-digit returns. Cedar Creek was up 5.2% on the year, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence. While we fell short of the major indices in 2024 we like the way the portfolio
is constructed and believe we can generate solid returns in the coming years.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,099.8%, net of fees and expenses.
Q4 ‘24 2024 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 0.4% 5.2% 1,099.8% 14.0%
NASDAQ 6.2% 28.6% 733.4% 11.8%
S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 24.9% 552.5% 10.4%
DJIA (DIA) 0.9% 15.2% 497.8% 9.9%
Russell 2000 0.3% 11.5% 307.4% 7.7%
Russell Microcap 5.9% 13.7% 217.9% 6.3%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,199,796
as of December 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $317,893 in the Russell MicroCap
and $833,425 in the NASDAQ.
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of December 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at
7.7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.2 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.0
times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.4. Dividend yield was 3.7%. Weighted expected return
on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 18.5%.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 8% largely due to
new money coming into the fund and a couple of holdings being acquired. There were no
major sales in the quarter.
We re-entered Evercel (expert: EVRC) after the Company strangely announced that any
shares sold after February 26, 2024 do not include the rights to its minority investment in
ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen protectors, which Evercel contributed to a
liquidating trust. This is unlikely to be true in our opinion since there is no evidence that the
transfer was reported to FINRA, no related security was issued, and trading was not halted.
In those cases, the security typically trades with all rights attached. We decided to purchase
shares after they plummeted for two reasons:
1. because in our opinion, we saw a great risk/reward opportunity believing the shares
are trading with full rights to potential ZAGG proceeds, and
2. since we had previously sold some shares after February 26, 2024 that were held on
February 26, 2024, we were effectively “hedged” on some of the shares we bought.3
Shares are currently at $0.26 per share just a bit above our average cost basis. Evercel has
27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in 2021 for
$200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over 50%
equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate about
$500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be worth
$28 million or four times the price we paid. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been
reduced, its value could be higher.
We also re-entered two old favorites Pardee Resources (otc: PDER) and Western Capital
Resources (expert: WCRS). Pardee Resources is a natural resources company with royalty
interests in coal, natural gas, timber and agriculture. Market cap is $200 million. Pardee paid
a $25 per share special year-end dividend in December and announced in October that it was
putting 47,000 acres of its timberland portfolio for sale. The purpose was to rebalance its
resource portfolio. The year-end special dividend is becoming regular. Pardee paid $15 per
share in 2021, $20 per share in 2022, $15 per share in 2023 and $25 per share in 2024. The
regular dividend is $1.80 per quarter. We estimate Pardee still has over $40 per share in cash
at year end. Trailing EBITDA per share is over $41. Most recent share price was $310 per
share.
Western Capital is a holding company whose primary holdings include 270 Cricket wireless
stores, Jackson & Perkins, a retailer of roses, plants and seed, and three ice rinks in Michigan.
It has significantly reduced its share count over the last year and a half. By usings its cash
to buy 255,564 shares from individuals at $4.58 per share average, and, more importantly,
by purchasing interests in two WCR Investment LLC’s which own approximately 63% of the
company’s shares it has effectively reduced its share count from 9.1 million to 6.0 million.
Date Cost Purchased effective # shares per share
Jun-23 $ 7,081,422 36.3% WCR Investment LLCs 2,023,263 $ 3.50
in 2024 $ 1,170,000 common stock 255,564 $ 4.58
Mar-24 $ 3,495,157 14.75% WCR Investment LLCs 822,390 $ 4.25
Total $11,746,579 3,101,217 $ 3.79
3 If the company was right in their interpretation, the shares we previously held, and subsequently sold, would
receive proceeds from any sale of ZAGG thus we would have a gain on those shares offsetting some of the loss on
the recently acquired shares.

Earnings for WCRS in 2022 were $10.2 million and in 2023 were $10.6 million. Reported
earnings are understated due to intangible amortization which was $2.0 million in 2022 and
$2.4 million in 2023. Thus, cash earnings were $12.2 million and $13.0 million in 2022 and
2023, respectively. In the first half of 2024, which is their stronger half, earnings were $7.2
million, or $1.20 per share. Cash earnings were $8.4 million, or $1.40 per share. Book value
as of June 30, 2024, was $90.4 million, or $15.07 per share. Net cash was $39.9 million, or
$6.65 per share. The company continues to look for acquisitions at 4-6 times EBITDA. Last
trade on the expert market was $9 per share. We were the happy buyers. Where else are
we going to be able to buy shares in a company for one times earnings, net of cash, in
company that has reduced its share count by nearly 35% in the last eighteen months?
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 31% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 75% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 10% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 5%, PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each
roughly 4% of the fund.
Most of the fund’s underperformance this year was due to the decline in the valuation of our
expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89
per share. At year end, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.603 per
share. PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $7 per share at the beginning of the year and $3.05
per share at the end of the year. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit
and was valued at $0.26 per unit as of year-end. First IC performed well. It increased from
$6.50 per share to $9.30 per share during the year and paid a $1 per share dividend. Despite
the poor performance from our major expert stocks in 2024 we believe they will generate
satisfactory returns for the fund over time.
Update on Our Control Positions
We decided to break out our control positions from other positions in the fund. By control,
we mean that I am on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making,
not that I have total control and get what I want. Both companies have strong boards, which
is the way it should be at all companies.
Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.25 per share to
$15.85 per share during the year. As a reminder, I am CEO and a board member of Solitron.
The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares. I own about 2.5% personally. During
the quarter Solitron released fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were just $17,000 or
$0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased
costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. We announced fiscal third quarter results in
January. Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share. Both quarters were negatively

impacted by lower revenues due to decreased backlog at the beginning of the year. That is
rapidly changing.
Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least twenty years. Bookings were
$8 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two year
order from L3Harris for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) – our second largest
defense program. We have been told to expect a $5 million order from our largest defense
program, AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) for RTX (formerly Raytheon)
in the current quarter. The order is expected to include parts for two or three years of SM-6
missile production as well.
At Solitron’s annual meeting in January I made
detailed comments regarding our largest
customers. HIMARS launcher vehicle production
capacity increased from 48 to 96 in 2024 (see
picture). They are running at maximum capacity.
Demand exceeds production based on its success
in Ukraine. While we do not know for certain, we
suspect our parts are used in launcher kits and not
the launch vehicles.
It has been reported that AMRAAM production has
been increased to 1,200 missiles annually. This is a 50% increase in just over two years.
Foreign governments have ordered, or requested to order, over 3,300 AMRAAM in the past
12-15 months. Solitron management expects both programs to run at maximum capacity
for a while.
It is still unknown what will happen with the US stockpile program that was part of the 2023
National Defense Authorization Act. The purpose was to replenish US stockpiles. A number
of programs were included. HIMARS, AMRAAM, and SM-6 were the major ones Solitron
supplies parts to. The Act approved 700 additional HIMARS launchers, 5,100 AMRAAMs, and
1,500 SM-6 missiles. In our minds it is impossible for the US government to replenish
stockpiles based on current production levels and foreign demand. For HIMARS it would take
more than seven years of full production to complete replenishment, but that would mean
allocating nothing to current US and foreign demand. For AMRAAM it would take over four
years of production. For SM-6, it would take over ten years based on reported production
levels of 125 missiles per year. If the government is serious about replenishing stockpiles it
would seem to require production levels for all three programs to be increased from current
levels. The problem is we just don’t know if the government will follow through on the
replenishment or not; regardless, all three programs have strong tail winds.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares,
and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $2.56 per
share to $3.07 in 2024. PharmChem also paid a $0.25 per share dividend in the fourth
quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative
to urine testing. Third quarter earnings were $0.076 per share. The company is debt free
and had $2.5 million in cash, or $0.53 per share before paying the dividend.
In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). PharmChem
will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger
or a debt financed special dividend. There have been numerous comments in the public
sphere by HHS Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Attorney General Pam Bondi, and
Vice President Vance pushing for a focus shift toward increased monitoring and prevention
versus the previous administration. This could be beneficial to PharmChem’s sales.

Update on Other Top Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7
million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program
(ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $37.70 per share at the
beginning of the year to $51.15 per share at the end of the year. In addition, they paid a
$1.00 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the last two
years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine months of
2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Results
in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on the same loan
that has now been fully reserved.
Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized
earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an
incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is
shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic
growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share
repurchases.
Propel Media (expert: PROM) – in January of 2024 the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV)
was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight.
As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to
$3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share
after becoming aware of the deal in published reports.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait.
Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In total we have received over
$0.055 per share in dividends, or 24% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend
in February. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3
and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts).
With a new administration having come into power, it is likely that significant changes will
occur at the FTC. Whether the parties will revisit their merger is unknown, but we do expect
to see a more business-friendly FTC over the next four years.
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price
rose during 2024 from $4.02 per share to $11.43 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge
Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets
under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at
the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield
Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website as of the end of January
2025, AUM was $3.5 billion. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for
short term bonds. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund, which has
raised over $30 million in its first four months.
ENDI’s third quarter operating margin was 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs
significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other
investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 48%.
Assuming similar adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter, quarterly cash earnings

should be approximately $0.32 per share, or $1.30 per share annualized.4 Net cash and
investments at the end of 2024 should be approximately $2.25 per share, meaning the stock
is trading at just seven to eight times earnings, net of cash.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in
our 2024 first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times
current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation
estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew AUM 30% in 2024! If we used the same
no growth valuation it would equate to $12.60 to $15.25 per share today with that value
increasing $0.35 per share every quarter due to earnings. But that would be absurd. In
hindsight we were way too conservative using an 8-10 times earnings plus net cash valuation.
We may still be too conservative, but using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash
earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $17.85 and $21.75 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 at the end of 2023 to
$0.26 per unit at the end of 2024. We covered the trust in great detail in our third quarter
letter. We think the Trustee is making a number of mistakes that are harming unitholders.
We have continued to add to our position throughout the year.
Change in Fund Administrator
The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of the end of
2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring

each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have

For the year, the NASDAQ rose 28.6% and the S&P500 (SPY) rose 24.9%. Other indices we track posted double-digit returns. Cedar Creek was up 5.2% on the year, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. While we fell short of the major indices in 2024 we like the way the portfolio is constructed and believe we can generate solid returns in the coming years. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,099.8%, net of fees and expenses. Q4 ‘24 2024 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 0.4% 5.2% 1,099.8% 14.0% NASDAQ 6.2% 28.6% 733.4% 11.8% S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 24.9% 552.5% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 0.9% 15.2% 497.8% 9.9% Russell 2000 0.3% 11.5% 307.4% 7.7% Russell Microcap 5.9% 13.7% 217.9% 6.3% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,199,796 as of December 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $317,893 in the Russell MicroCap and $833,425 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of December 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.2 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.0 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.4. Dividend yield was 3.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 18.5%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 8% largely due to new money coming into the fund and a couple of holdings being acquired. There were no major sales in the quarter. We re-entered Evercel (expert: EVRC) after the Company strangely announced that any shares sold after February 26, 2024 do not include the rights to its minority investment in ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen protectors, which Evercel contributed to a liquidating trust. This is unlikely to be true in our opinion since there is no evidence that the transfer was reported to FINRA, no related security was issued, and trading was not halted. In those cases, the security typically trades with all rights attached. We decided to purchase shares after they plummeted for two reasons: 1. because in our opinion, we saw a great risk/reward opportunity believing the shares are trading with full rights to potential ZAGG proceeds, and 2. since we had previously sold some shares after February 26, 2024 that were held on February 26, 2024, we were effectively “hedged” on some of the shares we bought. Shares are currently at $0.26 per share just a bit above our average cost basis. Evercel has 27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in 2021 for $200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over 50% equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate about $500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be worth $28 million or four times the price we paid. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been reduced, its value could be higher. We also re-entered two old favorites Pardee Resources (otc: PDER) and Western Capital Resources (expert: WCRS). Pardee Resources is a natural resources company with royalty interests in coal, natural gas, timber and agriculture. Market cap is $200 million. Pardee paid a $25 per share special year-end dividend in December and announced in October that it was putting 47,000 acres of its timberland portfolio for sale. The purpose was to rebalance its resource portfolio. The year-end special dividend is becoming regular. Pardee paid $15 per share in 2021, $20 per share in 2022, $15 per share in 2023 and $25 per share in 2024. The regular dividend is $1.80 per quarter. We estimate Pardee still has over $40 per share in cash at year end. Trailing EBITDA per share is over $41. Most recent share price was $310 per share. Western Capital is a holding company whose primary holdings include 270 Cricket wireless stores, Jackson & Perkins, a retailer of roses, plants and seed, and three ice rinks in Michigan. It has significantly reduced its share count over the last year and a half. By usings its cash to buy 255,564 shares from individuals at $4.58 per share average, and, more importantly, by purchasing interests in two WCR Investment LLC’s which own approximately 63% of the company’s shares it has effectively reduced its share count from 9.1 million to 6.0 million. Date Cost Purchased effective # shares per share Jun-23 $ 7,081,422 36.3% WCR Investment LLCs 2,023,263 $ 3.50 in 2024 $ 1,170,000 common stock 255,564 $ 4.58 Mar-24 $ 3,495,157 14.75% WCR Investment LLCs 822,390 $ 4.25 Total $11,746,579 3,101,217 $ 3.79 Earnings for WCRS in 2022 were $10.2 million and in 2023 were $10.6 million. Reported earnings are understated due to intangible amortization which was $2.0 million in 2022 and $2.4 million in 2023. Thus, cash earnings were $12.2 million and $13.0 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In the first half of 2024, which is their stronger half, earnings were $7.2 million, or $1.20 per share. Cash earnings were $8.4 million, or $1.40 per share. Book value as of June 30, 2024, was $90.4 million, or $15.07 per share. Net cash was $39.9 million, or $6.65 per share. The company continues to look for acquisitions at 4-6 times EBITDA. Last trade on the expert market was $9 per share. We were the happy buyers. Where else are we going to be able to buy shares in a company for one times earnings, net of cash, in company that has reduced its share count by nearly 35% in the last eighteen months? Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 31% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 75% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 10% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 5%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 4% of the fund. Most of the fund’s underperformance this year was due to the decline in the valuation of our expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89 per share. At year end, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.603 per share. PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $7 per share at the beginning of the year and $3.05 per share at the end of the year. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit and was valued at $0.26 per unit as of year-end. First IC performed well. It increased from $6.50 per share to $9.30 per share during the year and paid a $1 per share dividend. Despite the poor performance from our major expert stocks in 2024 we believe they will generate satisfactory returns for the fund over time. Update on Our Control Positions We decided to break out our control positions from other positions in the fund. By control, we mean that I am on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that I have total control and get what I want. Both companies have strong boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.25 per share to $15.85 per share during the year. As a reminder, I am CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares. I own about 2.5% personally. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were just $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. We announced fiscal third quarter results in January. Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share. Both quarters were negatively impacted by lower revenues due to decreased backlog at the beginning of the year. That is rapidly changing. Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least twenty years. Bookings were $8 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two year order from L3Harris for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) – our second largest defense program. We have been told to expect a $5 million order from our largest defense program, AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) for RTX (formerly Raytheon) in the current quarter. The order is expected to include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well. At Solitron’s annual meeting in January I made detailed comments regarding our largest customers. HIMARS launcher vehicle production capacity increased from 48 to 96 in 2024 (see picture). They are running at maximum capacity. Demand exceeds production based on its success in Ukraine. While we do not know for certain, we suspect our parts are used in launcher kits and not the launch vehicles. It has been reported that AMRAAM production has been increased to 1,200 missiles annually. This is a 50% increase in just over two years. Foreign governments have ordered, or requested to order, over 3,300 AMRAAM in the past 12-15 months. Solitron management expects both programs to run at maximum capacity for a while. It is still unknown what will happen with the US stockpile program that was part of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. The purpose was to replenish US stockpiles. A number of programs were included. HIMARS, AMRAAM, and SM-6 were the major ones Solitron supplies parts to. The Act approved 700 additional HIMARS launchers, 5,100 AMRAAMs, and 1,500 SM-6 missiles. In our minds it is impossible for the US government to replenish stockpiles based on current production levels and foreign demand. For HIMARS it would take more than seven years of full production to complete replenishment, but that would mean allocating nothing to current US and foreign demand. For AMRAAM it would take over four years of production. For SM-6, it would take over ten years based on reported production levels of 125 missiles per year. If the government is serious about replenishing stockpiles it would seem to require production levels for all three programs to be increased from current levels. The problem is we just don’t know if the government will follow through on the replenishment or not; regardless, all three programs have strong tail winds. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $2.56 per share to $3.07 in 2024. PharmChem also paid a $0.25 per share dividend in the fourth quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Third quarter earnings were $0.076 per share. The company is debt free and had $2.5 million in cash, or $0.53 per share before paying the dividend. In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. There have been numerous comments in the public sphere by HHS Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Vice President Vance pushing for a focus shift toward increased monitoring and prevention versus the previous administration. This could be beneficial to PharmChem’s sales. Update on Other Top Holdings Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $37.70 per share at the beginning of the year to $51.15 per share at the end of the year. In addition, they paid a $1.00 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the last two years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine months of 2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Results in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on the same loan that has now been fully reserved. Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Propel Media (expert: PROM) – in January of 2024 the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In total we have received over $0.055 per share in dividends, or 24% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in February. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts). With a new administration having come into power, it is likely that significant changes will occur at the FTC. Whether the parties will revisit their merger is unknown, but we do expect to see a more business-friendly FTC over the next four years. ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price rose during 2024 from $4.02 per share to $11.43 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website as of the end of January 2025, AUM was $3.5 billion. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund, which has raised over $30 million in its first four months. ENDI’s third quarter operating margin was 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 48%. Assuming similar adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.32 per share, or $1.30 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of 2024 should be approximately $2.25 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just seven to eight times earnings, net of cash. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in our 2024 first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew AUM 30% in 2024! If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $12.60 to $15.25 per share today with that value increasing $0.35 per share every quarter due to earnings. But that would be absurd. In hindsight we were way too conservative using an 8-10 times earnings plus net cash valuation. We may still be too conservative, but using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $17.85 and $21.75 per share. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 at the end of 2023 to $0.26 per unit at the end of 2024. We covered the trust in great detail in our third quarter letter. We think the Trustee is making a number of mistakes that are harming unitholders. We have continued to add to our position throughout the year. Change in Fund Administrator The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of the end of 2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Stock markets in 2024 continued to be led by the NASDAQ and a few major tech stocks. For
the year, the NASDAQ rose 28.6% and the S&P500 (SPY) rose 24.9%. Other indices we track
posted double-digit returns. Cedar Creek was up 5.2% on the year, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence. While we fell short of the major indices in 2024 we like the way the portfolio
is constructed and believe we can generate solid returns in the coming years.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,099.8%, net of fees and expenses.

$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,199,796
as of December 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $317,893 in the Russell MicroCap
and $833,425 in the NASDAQ.
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of December 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at
7.7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.2 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.0
times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.4. Dividend yield was 3.7%. Weighted expected return
on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 18.5%.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 8% largely due to
new money coming into the fund and a couple of holdings being acquired. There were no
major sales in the quarter.
We re-entered Evercel (expert: EVRC) after the Company strangely announced that any
shares sold after February 26, 2024 do not include the rights to its minority investment in
ZAGG, the maker of cell phone covers and screen protectors, which Evercel contributed to a
liquidating trust. This is unlikely to be true in our opinion since there is no evidence that the
transfer was reported to FINRA, no related security was issued, and trading was not halted.
In those cases, the security typically trades with all rights attached. We decided to purchase
shares after they plummeted for two reasons:
1. because in our opinion, we saw a great risk/reward opportunity believing the shares
are trading with full rights to potential ZAGG proceeds, and
2. since we had previously sold some shares after February 26, 2024 that were held on
February 26, 2024, we were effectively “hedged” on some of the shares we bought.3
Shares are currently at $0.26 per share just a bit above our average cost basis. Evercel has
27.1 million shares for a market cap of just $7 million. ZAGG was purchased in 2021 for
$200 million, $70 million of which was equity. Evercel paid $36 million for just over 50%
equity ownership, which was later reduced to 40%. ZAGG was expected to generate about
$500 million in sales. If ZAGG was still worth what Evercel paid in 2021 it would be worth
$28 million or four times the price we paid. If sales have grown, and/or debt has been
reduced, its value could be higher.
We also re-entered two old favorites Pardee Resources (otc: PDER) and Western Capital
Resources (expert: WCRS). Pardee Resources is a natural resources company with royalty
interests in coal, natural gas, timber and agriculture. Market cap is $200 million. Pardee paid
a $25 per share special year-end dividend in December and announced in October that it was
putting 47,000 acres of its timberland portfolio for sale. The purpose was to rebalance its
resource portfolio. The year-end special dividend is becoming regular. Pardee paid $15 per
share in 2021, $20 per share in 2022, $15 per share in 2023 and $25 per share in 2024. The
regular dividend is $1.80 per quarter. We estimate Pardee still has over $40 per share in cash
at year end. Trailing EBITDA per share is over $41. Most recent share price was $310 per
share.
Western Capital is a holding company whose primary holdings include 270 Cricket wireless
stores, Jackson & Perkins, a retailer of roses, plants and seed, and three ice rinks in Michigan.
It has significantly reduced its share count over the last year and a half. By usings its cash
to buy 255,564 shares from individuals at $4.58 per share average, and, more importantly,
by purchasing interests in two WCR Investment LLC’s which own approximately 63% of the
company’s shares it has effectively reduced its share count from 9.1 million to 6.0 million.
Date Cost Purchased effective # shares per share
Jun-23 $ 7,081,422 36.3% WCR Investment LLCs 2,023,263 $ 3.50
in 2024 $ 1,170,000 common stock 255,564 $ 4.58
Mar-24 $ 3,495,157 14.75% WCR Investment LLCs 822,390 $ 4.25
Total $11,746,579 3,101,217 $ 3.79
3 If the company was right in their interpretation, the shares we previously held, and subsequently sold, would
receive proceeds from any sale of ZAGG thus we would have a gain on those shares offsetting some of the loss on
the recently acquired shares.

Earnings for WCRS in 2022 were $10.2 million and in 2023 were $10.6 million. Reported
earnings are understated due to intangible amortization which was $2.0 million in 2022 and
$2.4 million in 2023. Thus, cash earnings were $12.2 million and $13.0 million in 2022 and
2023, respectively. In the first half of 2024, which is their stronger half, earnings were $7.2
million, or $1.20 per share. Cash earnings were $8.4 million, or $1.40 per share. Book value
as of June 30, 2024, was $90.4 million, or $15.07 per share. Net cash was $39.9 million, or
$6.65 per share. The company continues to look for acquisitions at 4-6 times EBITDA. Last
trade on the expert market was $9 per share. We were the happy buyers. Where else are
we going to be able to buy shares in a company for one times earnings, net of cash, in
company that has reduced its share count by nearly 35% in the last eighteen months?
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 31% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 75% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 10% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 5%, PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each
roughly 4% of the fund.
Most of the fund’s underperformance this year was due to the decline in the valuation of our
expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89
per share. At year end, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.603 per
share. PD-Rx was valued at last sale of $7 per share at the beginning of the year and $3.05
per share at the end of the year. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit
and was valued at $0.26 per unit as of year-end. First IC performed well. It increased from
$6.50 per share to $9.30 per share during the year and paid a $1 per share dividend. Despite
the poor performance from our major expert stocks in 2024 we believe they will generate
satisfactory returns for the fund over time.
Update on Our Control Positions
We decided to break out our control positions from other positions in the fund. By control,
we mean that I am on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making,
not that I have total control and get what I want. Both companies have strong boards, which
is the way it should be at all companies.
Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.25 per share to
$15.85 per share during the year. As a reminder, I am CEO and a board member of Solitron.
The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares. I own about 2.5% personally. During
the quarter Solitron released fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were just $17,000 or
$0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased
costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. We announced fiscal third quarter results in
January. Earnings were $266,000, or $0.13 per share. Both quarters were negatively

impacted by lower revenues due to decreased backlog at the beginning of the year. That is
rapidly changing.
Solitron had its largest quarterly bookings (orders) in at least twenty years. Bookings were
$8 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two year
order from L3Harris for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) – our second largest
defense program. We have been told to expect a $5 million order from our largest defense
program, AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) for RTX (formerly Raytheon)
in the current quarter. The order is expected to include parts for two or three years of SM-6
missile production as well.
At Solitron’s annual meeting in January I made
detailed comments regarding our largest
customers. HIMARS launcher vehicle production
capacity increased from 48 to 96 in 2024 (see
picture). They are running at maximum capacity.
Demand exceeds production based on its success
in Ukraine. While we do not know for certain, we
suspect our parts are used in launcher kits and not
the launch vehicles.
It has been reported that AMRAAM production has
been increased to 1,200 missiles annually. This is a 50% increase in just over two years.
Foreign governments have ordered, or requested to order, over 3,300 AMRAAM in the past
12-15 months. Solitron management expects both programs to run at maximum capacity
for a while.
It is still unknown what will happen with the US stockpile program that was part of the 2023
National Defense Authorization Act. The purpose was to replenish US stockpiles. A number
of programs were included. HIMARS, AMRAAM, and SM-6 were the major ones Solitron
supplies parts to. The Act approved 700 additional HIMARS launchers, 5,100 AMRAAMs, and
1,500 SM-6 missiles. In our minds it is impossible for the US government to replenish
stockpiles based on current production levels and foreign demand. For HIMARS it would take
more than seven years of full production to complete replenishment, but that would mean
allocating nothing to current US and foreign demand. For AMRAAM it would take over four
years of production. For SM-6, it would take over ten years based on reported production
levels of 125 missiles per year. If the government is serious about replenishing stockpiles it
would seem to require production levels for all three programs to be increased from current
levels. The problem is we just don’t know if the government will follow through on the
replenishment or not; regardless, all three programs have strong tail winds.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares,
and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $2.56 per
share to $3.07 in 2024. PharmChem also paid a $0.25 per share dividend in the fourth
quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative
to urine testing. Third quarter earnings were $0.076 per share. The company is debt free
and had $2.5 million in cash, or $0.53 per share before paying the dividend.
In January 2025 we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). PharmChem
will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger
or a debt financed special dividend. There have been numerous comments in the public
sphere by HHS Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Attorney General Pam Bondi, and
Vice President Vance pushing for a focus shift toward increased monitoring and prevention
versus the previous administration. This could be beneficial to PharmChem’s sales.

Update on Other Top Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7
million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program
(ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $37.70 per share at the
beginning of the year to $51.15 per share at the end of the year. In addition, they paid a
$1.00 per share dividend. Citizens has reduced its share count by 10% over the last two
years, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first nine months of
2024 were $4.55 per share versus $4.23 per share in the first nine months of 2023. Results
in both years were negatively impacted by $3 million loan loss provisions on the same loan
that has now been fully reserved.
Due to the ECIP funds Citizens is one of the most over capitalized banks in the US. Annualized
earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an
incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is
shareholder friendly. We expect them to either make an acquisition or increase organic
growth, all the while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share
repurchases.
Propel Media (expert: PROM) – in January of 2024 the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV)
was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight.
As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to
$3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share
after becoming aware of the deal in published reports.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait.
Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In total we have received over
$0.055 per share in dividends, or 24% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend
in February. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3
and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts).
With a new administration having come into power, it is likely that significant changes will
occur at the FTC. Whether the parties will revisit their merger is unknown, but we do expect
to see a more business-friendly FTC over the next four years.
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price
rose during 2024 from $4.02 per share to $11.43 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge
Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets
under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at
the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield
Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website as of the end of January
2025, AUM was $3.5 billion. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for
short term bonds. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund, which has
raised over $30 million in its first four months.
ENDI’s third quarter operating margin was 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs
significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other
investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 48%.
Assuming similar adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter, quarterly cash earnings

should be approximately $0.32 per share, or $1.30 per share annualized.4 Net cash and
investments at the end of 2024 should be approximately $2.25 per share, meaning the stock
is trading at just seven to eight times earnings, net of cash.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in
our 2024 first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times
current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation
estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew AUM 30% in 2024! If we used the same
no growth valuation it would equate to $12.60 to $15.25 per share today with that value
increasing $0.35 per share every quarter due to earnings. But that would be absurd. In
hindsight we were way too conservative using an 8-10 times earnings plus net cash valuation.
We may still be too conservative, but using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash
earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $17.85 and $21.75 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 at the end of 2023 to
$0.26 per unit at the end of 2024. We covered the trust in great detail in our third quarter
letter. We think the Trustee is making a number of mistakes that are harming unitholders.
We have continued to add to our position throughout the year.
Change in Fund Administrator
The fund was recently notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of the end of
2024. We have changed our administrator to Fleming Fund Services as of January 2025.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

4 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

The cover image shows a magazine ad from 1948 for Farrow’s, a British
manufacturer of canned fruits and vegetables and other food products. Farrow’s
was founded in the mid-1840s and initially focused on production of mushroom
ketchup and mustard, briefly becoming the largest mustard producer in Britain
at the turn of the 20th century. They pivoted into canning fruits and vegetables,
principally giant marrowfat peas, in the 1930s and enjoyed a decades-long
period of expansion and prosperity. Shortly after the original print of this ad,
however, the star of canned foods began to wane, and the Farrow’s canned
vegetable business subsequently changed hands a number of times in the
ensuing years.
Today, the Farrow’s brand is owned by Alluvial Fund investment NewPrinces
Group. Continue reading the letter to learn more about NewPrinces.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund rose 8.5% in the second quarter, building on its robust start to bring year-to-date
returns to 15.6%. At June 30, comparable US benchmarks remained in negative territory for the
year. I am pleased with our returns thus far this year, but of course, never satisfied. There are always
improvements to our research processes that can be made; our task at Alluvial is to make them.

First there were tariffs. Then there mostly weren’t. Now there are tariffs again, probably? It’s
dizzying. Markets are no longer taking tariff announcements at face value, which explains the
muted reaction to recent proclamations. Our direct exposure to these tariffs remains very limited.
Exports to the United States make up only a small fraction of our portfolio companies’ revenue.
The indirect effects of this unstable tariff regime will have a greater impact. Changes in consumer
and business confidence, currency levels, and the outlook for continued economic growth present
a fraught business environment for our holdings to navigate. Alluvial has always had a strong
preference for “basic” businesses that deal in essential goods and services, produce predictable
cash flows, and maintain strong balance sheets. These are the businesses that are ready for a rainy
day, whenever it may arrive. And it always does, eventually. I live in Pittsburgh, so I know a bit
about rain.
Portfolio Contributors
Talen Energy was the biggest contributor to this quarter’s returns. In June, the company
announced an agreement with Amazon to provide 1,920 megawatts of nuclear power to Amazon
datacenters through 2042. The agreement provides a highly valuable long-term earnings stream
for Talen. When power delivery reaches scale in 2032, Talen expects the agreement to provide
incremental annual free cash flow per share of at least $7. I think this guidance will prove far too
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

conservative based on continued share repurchases. Talen continues to shift its activities away
from merchant power production and toward providing clean energy to datacenters on long-term,
highly predictable contracts. As a result, investors are starting to value Talen shares less like those
of an electricity wildcatter and more like a quasi-regulated utility with a blue-chip end customer.
Every business would love to find a way to make more money and take less risk doing it, and that’s
exactly what Talen is achieving.
A portion of Talen’s rise is due to the market’s exuberance over anything relating to AI and data
centers. But unlike the AI darlings trading at 50 or 100 times their 2030 wildest fantasy earnings,
Talen’s valuation remains grounded in reality at just a mid-teens multiple of 2026 free cash flow.
Just hours after I finished the first draft of this missive, Talen announced an agreement to purchase
two modern high-efficiency combined-cycle gas generation facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
These plants will help Talen satisfy the
burgeoning demand for power from the
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 6/30/25 (%)
data center industry. The purchase is hugely
beneficial to Talen’s free cash flow. Shares Zegona Communications plc. 10.6

I will be over the moon if a sale to Telefónica

nor is it necessary for a great outcome. In my

view, the most likely scenario continues to be
a sale of the fiber assets, followed by a return
of capital and continued operational improvements at Vodafone Spain. Zegona’s June 30 reporting
showed customer growth, improving margins and robust cash flow.
Shares of Zegona have more than doubled from our average purchase price. While I continue to
believe in the company’s prospects, there is no question that the risk/reward on offer is not quite
what it was when shares traded at GBp 250. With that in mind, we have been trimming our Zegona
position, preferring to keep some cash in reserve for other opportunities or to re-buy Zegona
shares if they head lower.
Our other UK-traded holding, McBride Plc, also enjoyed a strong quarter. A university endowment
had been a consistent seller of McBride shares, but ran out of shares to sell near quarter-end.
Unfortunately, investors took a dim view of McBride’s July trading update and sent shares
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

tumbling. The update didn’t contain anything surprising, just a recognition that the trend of
European consumers trading down to private label soaps and detergents is plateauing and
that margins would retreat from record highs. This was always the case. McBride operates in a
competitive industry where bumper profits simply don’t last. However, I expect McBride to enjoy
some permanent margin uplift thanks to its increased scale and investments in automation. Even
if operating margins retreated all the way to pre-COVID averages, McBride would still be trading
at mid-single-digit earnings multiple. McBride
has succeeded in normalizing its balance

When we first began buying Seneca Foods, Denmark 1.4
the company was coming off a bumper

vegetable harvest. This meant a lot of corn
and green beans to pack, resulting in high Total 100%
inventory and big borrowings on Seneca’s
working capital line of credit. This scared off a lot of investors, but an occasional big pack year is
just how it goes for Seneca. When the beans grow, can them. They know that for every bumper
crop, there will be a year with more meager yields. Sure enough, this past year saw a modest
harvest, and Seneca reduced its borrowings by $259 million, or a whopping $37 per share.
Seneca’s balance sheet has normalized, to the benefit of shareholders. Intriguingly, a Seneca
competitor, Del Monte, has entered bankruptcy after years of financial struggles. The bankruptcy
may present Seneca with the opportunity to pick up some attractive assets at good prices.
Adding...
We added a significant new holding to the Alluvial Fund portfolio this quarter, NewPrinces SpA.
While nominally an Italian company with shares traded in Milan, NewPrinces is rapidly becoming
a pan-European leader in branded foods. Formerly known as Newlat Foods, NewPrinces got its
start in the pasta industry. From there, the company expanded into dairy, baking products, instant
noodles, baby foods, canned tomatoes, oils, beverages, and canned seafoods. The strategy is
simple. NewPrinces buys small food divisions from larger companies, often multi-nationals like
Kraft Heinz or Mitsubishi. The brands NewPrinces buys are typically mature and often somewhat
neglected. Their owners are happy to sell in order to reinvest in faster-growing, trendier product
lines. Once acquired, NewPrinces gets to work wringing out production efficiencies and striving to
reduce net working capital, effectively reducing their purchase price.
NewPrinces’ most significant acquisition to date was the July 2024 purchase of Princes Limited,

integration of Princes, NewPrinces has stayed busy on the acquisition front, buying a Diageo
factory in Northern Italy and agreeing to buy Kraft Heinz’s European baby foods business for €120
million.
The market has rewarded NewPrinces shares for its series of successful acquisitions, but the shares
remain attractively priced. The company is rumored to be working on another sizable acquisition,
which could result in shares reaching new heights.
We have also bought shares of SigmaRoc Plc, a leading European producer of lime and minerals.
SigmaRoc is another serial acquirer with an impressive record of buying the cast-offs of larger
producers. SigmaRoc is the top lime producer in Scandinavia, the UK and Ireland, and much of
Western Europe, and the number 2 producer in Germany, Poland, and Czechia. Lime is a critical
input for numerous industrial processes, ranging from steelmaking to construction to food and
beverage and cosmetics. Limestone producers have attractive economic characteristics reminiscent
of cement and aggregates. Namely, they enjoy strong regional moats thanks to transportation
costs and the challenges of bringing new
quarries into production. I like SigmaRoc’s TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 6/30/25 (%)

The Real Estate Update
Out-of-favor commercial real estate continues to be a theme in our portfolio. Our biggest real
estate holding, Net Lease Office Properties, has eliminated all corporate-level debt and is
poised to begin returning capital soon. PeakStone Realty continues its transition into an industrial
outdoor storage-focused REIT. And lastly, CBL Properties continues to reduce leverage and divest
its marginal mall properties.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

Net Lease Office Properties recently succeeded in selling a vacant Texas office property at an
attractive valuation of $80 per square foot. The company is actively marketing several of its
remaining higher-value properties. The company currently has distributable cash on hand of
around $3, with more coming in each month. Excluding mortgaged properties, Net Lease is
currently trading at a capitalization rate of around 18%. I continue to believe shares are worth $45-
50.
PeakStone Realty has now sold all its non-core properties, and is currently marketing another
office building that is expected to bring in $100 million. Once sold, PeakStone will have reached
its leverage target and can then focus entirely on growing its industrial outdoor storage platform.
Valuing only currently leased industrial properties using a 6% cap rate and valuing the remaining
offices using a 9% cap rate yields net asset value of $30 per share. This should be discounted for
ongoing corporate costs, but the company’s robust free cash flow yield supports a fair value much
higher than current trading around $14.
In April, CBL Properties announced it had met the conditions to extend its term loan maturity
to late 2026, and that it expects to further extend the loan to November 2027. The company
continues to have ample unrestricted cash on hand, and to have success in refinancing its premiere
properties at lower costs. Earlier this month, the company announced it had refinanced the loan
on its Cross Creek Mall property at a 6.9% rate, down from 8.2%. CBL will continue to dedicate its
cash flow to a combination of debt reduction, return of capital, and investment in its best assets.
Special Situations
The stock market is about as ebullient as I have ever seen. Every day it seems some previously
obscure company is rocketing to fame and riches by announcing a “Bitcoin Treasury Policy” or
some other crypto-related initiative. And whenever I see speculative fervor growing, it makes me
want to own more special situations: securities and situations that can provide positive absolute
returns regardless of the market environment. Alluvial Fund has always had an allocation to special
situations, the size of which changes depending upon the opportunity set. Given prevailing market
sentiments, I think the time is right to increase our allocation to special situations that meet our
risk/reward parameters.
One such holding is ContextLogic, Inc. ContextLogic is what remains of the former Wish.
com, a former e-commerce highflyer that crashed and was sold for scraps. Following the
sale of its operating subsidiary, ContextLogic has a large pot of cash, minimal liabilities, and
enormous net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which can be used to offset future taxable
income. ContextLogic has partnered with large global alternative investment firm BC Partners
to find potential acquisitions. BC has invested $75 million in convertible preferred shares of
a ContextLogic subsidiary and has the right to invest another $75 million on the same terms.
Assuming BC exercises its rights, ContextLogic has just over $6.50 per share in cash with which to
pursue an acquisition. If ContextLogic can find the right acquisition and execute well, its tax assets
alone could be worth >100% of its current market capitalization.
This is not our first time investing in an “NOL shell.” We have also tracked a good number of
NOL shells over the years and we have seen what does and does not result in good outcomes. To
succeed with an NOL monetization strategy, the NOL shell must have the following:
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

1. Long-lived NOLs, and the more the better. If most of a company’s NOLs expire in just
a few years, the company is incentivized to make any deal it can, not the right deal for
shareholders. ContextLogic has $2 billion of federal NOLs that do not expire.
2. Adequate cash and a low burn rate. Under-capitalized NOL shells risk blowing through their
cash before identifying an acquisition. ContextLogic currently has $222 million in cash on
hand and a very low burn rate. Overhead costs are mostly offset by interest income.
3. Dealflow. Doing a good acquisition is hard, and it is harder without access to opportunities.
ContextLogic’s partnership with BC Partners ensure that CEO Rishi Bajaj will get a lot of
“looks” at potential acquisition targets.
We were able to buy a reasonable number of ContextLogic shares from forced sellers following
the company’s delisting from the NASDAQ. Even now, with shares rebounding, buyers are paying
very little for the tax assets. Our downside is well-protected by the company’s balance sheet cash.
If ContextLogic is unable to complete an acquisition on reasonable timeline, the company will
liquidate.
In addition to ContextLogic, we are actively increasing our holdings in liquidation scenarios and
other special situations. These will provide some portfolio “ballast” in the event the market’s mood
turns sour.
In Summary
We are having a very good year. I do not know if the good times will continue, but I am as excited
as ever about our collection of securities. They are both deeply undervalued and well off the radar
of most investors. The market may have a difficult time getting excited about SigmaRoc’s lime or
Seneca Foods’ canned Lima beans, but I have found that given enough time, the market does
respect cash flows.
As always, I greatly appreciate the opportunity to manage capital on your behalf. All of my and
my family’s assets are invested alongside yours. If you have any questions about the portfolio or
Alluvial’s strategy, I am ever at your disposal. Please do not hesitate to e-mail or call. I look forward
to writing to you once again in October.

The cover image shows a magazine ad from 1948 for Farrow’s, a British
manufacturer of canned fruits and vegetables and other food products. Farrow’s
was founded in the mid-1840s and initially focused on production of mushroom
ketchup and mustard, briefly becoming the largest mustard producer in Britain
at the turn of the 20th century. They pivoted into canning fruits and vegetables,
principally giant marrowfat peas, in the 1930s and enjoyed a decades-long
period of expansion and prosperity. Shortly after the original print of this ad,
however, the star of canned foods began to wane, and the Farrow’s canned
vegetable business subsequently changed hands a number of times in the
ensuing years.
Today, the Farrow’s brand is owned by Alluvial Fund investment NewPrinces
Group. Continue reading the letter to learn more about NewPrinces.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund rose 8.5% in the second quarter, building on its robust start to bring year-to-date
returns to 15.6%. At June 30, comparable US benchmarks remained in negative territory for the
year. I am pleased with our returns thus far this year, but of course, never satisfied. There are always
improvements to our research processes that can be made; our task at Alluvial is to make them.

First there were tariffs. Then there mostly weren’t. Now there are tariffs again, probably? It’s
dizzying. Markets are no longer taking tariff announcements at face value, which explains the
muted reaction to recent proclamations. Our direct exposure to these tariffs remains very limited.
Exports to the United States make up only a small fraction of our portfolio companies’ revenue.
The indirect effects of this unstable tariff regime will have a greater impact. Changes in consumer
and business confidence, currency levels, and the outlook for continued economic growth present
a fraught business environment for our holdings to navigate. Alluvial has always had a strong
preference for “basic” businesses that deal in essential goods and services, produce predictable
cash flows, and maintain strong balance sheets. These are the businesses that are ready for a rainy
day, whenever it may arrive. And it always does, eventually. I live in Pittsburgh, so I know a bit
about rain.

Talen Energy was the biggest contributor to this quarter’s returns. In June, the company
announced an agreement with Amazon to provide 1,920 megawatts of nuclear power to Amazon
datacenters through 2042. The agreement provides a highly valuable long-term earnings stream
for Talen. When power delivery reaches scale in 2032, Talen expects the agreement to provide
incremental annual free cash flow per share of at least $7. I think this guidance will prove far too
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

conservative based on continued share repurchases. Talen continues to shift its activities away
from merchant power production and toward providing clean energy to datacenters on long-term,
highly predictable contracts. As a result, investors are starting to value Talen shares less like those
of an electricity wildcatter and more like a quasi-regulated utility with a blue-chip end customer.
Every business would love to find a way to make more money and take less risk doing it, and that’s
exactly what Talen is achieving.
A portion of Talen’s rise is due to the market’s exuberance over anything relating to AI and data
centers. But unlike the AI darlings trading at 50 or 100 times their 2030 wildest fantasy earnings,
Talen’s valuation remains grounded in reality at just a mid-teens multiple of 2026 free cash flow.
Just hours after I finished the first draft of this missive, Talen announced an agreement to purchase
two modern high-efficiency combined-cycle gas generation facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
These plants will help Talen satisfy the
burgeoning demand for power from the
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 6/30/25 (%)
data center industry. The purchase is hugely
beneficial to Talen’s free cash flow. Shares Zegona Communications plc. 10.6

nor is it necessary for a great outcome. In my

view, the most likely scenario continues to be
a sale of the fiber assets, followed by a return
of capital and continued operational improvements at Vodafone Spain. Zegona’s June 30 reporting
showed customer growth, improving margins and robust cash flow.
Shares of Zegona have more than doubled from our average purchase price. While I continue to
believe in the company’s prospects, there is no question that the risk/reward on offer is not quite
what it was when shares traded at GBp 250. With that in mind, we have been trimming our Zegona
position, preferring to keep some cash in reserve for other opportunities or to re-buy Zegona
shares if they head lower.
Our other UK-traded holding, McBride Plc, also enjoyed a strong quarter. A university endowment
had been a consistent seller of McBride shares, but ran out of shares to sell near quarter-end.
Unfortunately, investors took a dim view of McBride’s July trading update and sent shares
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

tumbling. The update didn’t contain anything surprising, just a recognition that the trend of
European consumers trading down to private label soaps and detergents is plateauing and
that margins would retreat from record highs. This was always the case. McBride operates in a
competitive industry where bumper profits simply don’t last. However, I expect McBride to enjoy
some permanent margin uplift thanks to its increased scale and investments in automation. Even
if operating margins retreated all the way to pre-COVID averages, McBride would still be trading
at mid-single-digit earnings multiple. McBride
has succeeded in normalizing its balance

Rounding out this quarter’s winners is Seneca

When we first began buying Seneca Foods, Denmark 1.4
the company was coming off a bumper

vegetable harvest. This meant a lot of corn
and green beans to pack, resulting in high Total 100%
inventory and big borrowings on Seneca’s
working capital line of credit. This scared off a lot of investors, but an occasional big pack year is
just how it goes for Seneca. When the beans grow, can them. They know that for every bumper
crop, there will be a year with more meager yields. Sure enough, this past year saw a modest
harvest, and Seneca reduced its borrowings by $259 million, or a whopping $37 per share.
Seneca’s balance sheet has normalized, to the benefit of shareholders. Intriguingly, a Seneca
competitor, Del Monte, has entered bankruptcy after years of financial struggles. The bankruptcy
may present Seneca with the opportunity to pick up some attractive assets at good prices.
Adding...
We added a significant new holding to the Alluvial Fund portfolio this quarter, NewPrinces SpA.
While nominally an Italian company with shares traded in Milan, NewPrinces is rapidly becoming
a pan-European leader in branded foods. Formerly known as Newlat Foods, NewPrinces got its
start in the pasta industry. From there, the company expanded into dairy, baking products, instant
noodles, baby foods, canned tomatoes, oils, beverages, and canned seafoods. The strategy is
simple. NewPrinces buys small food divisions from larger companies, often multi-nationals like
Kraft Heinz or Mitsubishi. The brands NewPrinces buys are typically mature and often somewhat
neglected. Their owners are happy to sell in order to reinvest in faster-growing, trendier product
lines. Once acquired, NewPrinces gets to work wringing out production efficiencies and striving to
reduce net working capital, effectively reducing their purchase price.
NewPrinces’ most significant acquisition to date was the July 2024 purchase of Princes Limited,
a venerable producer of classic British foods with £1.7 billion in revenue. With the purchase,
NewPrinces more than tripled its revenue base and set itself up to IPO in London, aiming to
float 25% of its now majority-UK business later this year. Following the purchase and successful
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

integration of Princes, NewPrinces has stayed busy on the acquisition front, buying a Diageo
factory in Northern Italy and agreeing to buy Kraft Heinz’s European baby foods business for €120
million.
The market has rewarded NewPrinces shares for its series of successful acquisitions, but the shares
remain attractively priced. The company is rumored to be working on another sizable acquisition,
which could result in shares reaching new heights.
We have also bought shares of SigmaRoc Plc, a leading European producer of lime and minerals.
SigmaRoc is another serial acquirer with an impressive record of buying the cast-offs of larger
producers. SigmaRoc is the top lime producer in Scandinavia, the UK and Ireland, and much of
Western Europe, and the number 2 producer in Germany, Poland, and Czechia. Lime is a critical
input for numerous industrial processes, ranging from steelmaking to construction to food and
beverage and cosmetics. Limestone producers have attractive economic characteristics reminiscent
of cement and aggregates. Namely, they enjoy strong regional moats thanks to transportation
costs and the challenges of bringing new
quarries into production. I like SigmaRoc’s TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 6/30/25 (%)

Following the partial sale of the US business,

The Real Estate Update
Out-of-favor commercial real estate continues to be a theme in our portfolio. Our biggest real
estate holding, Net Lease Office Properties, has eliminated all corporate-level debt and is
poised to begin returning capital soon. PeakStone Realty continues its transition into an industrial
outdoor storage-focused REIT. And lastly, CBL Properties continues to reduce leverage and divest
its marginal mall properties.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

Net Lease Office Properties recently succeeded in selling a vacant Texas office property at an
attractive valuation of $80 per square foot. The company is actively marketing several of its
remaining higher-value properties. The company currently has distributable cash on hand of
around $3, with more coming in each month. Excluding mortgaged properties, Net Lease is
currently trading at a capitalization rate of around 18%. I continue to believe shares are worth $45-
50.
PeakStone Realty has now sold all its non-core properties, and is currently marketing another
office building that is expected to bring in $100 million. Once sold, PeakStone will have reached
its leverage target and can then focus entirely on growing its industrial outdoor storage platform.
Valuing only currently leased industrial properties using a 6% cap rate and valuing the remaining
offices using a 9% cap rate yields net asset value of $30 per share. This should be discounted for
ongoing corporate costs, but the company’s robust free cash flow yield supports a fair value much
higher than current trading around $14.
In April, CBL Properties announced it had met the conditions to extend its term loan maturity
to late 2026, and that it expects to further extend the loan to November 2027. The company
continues to have ample unrestricted cash on hand, and to have success in refinancing its premiere
properties at lower costs. Earlier this month, the company announced it had refinanced the loan
on its Cross Creek Mall property at a 6.9% rate, down from 8.2%. CBL will continue to dedicate its
cash flow to a combination of debt reduction, return of capital, and investment in its best assets.
Special Situations
The stock market is about as ebullient as I have ever seen. Every day it seems some previously
obscure company is rocketing to fame and riches by announcing a “Bitcoin Treasury Policy” or
some other crypto-related initiative. And whenever I see speculative fervor growing, it makes me
want to own more special situations: securities and situations that can provide positive absolute
returns regardless of the market environment. Alluvial Fund has always had an allocation to special
situations, the size of which changes depending upon the opportunity set. Given prevailing market
sentiments, I think the time is right to increase our allocation to special situations that meet our
risk/reward parameters.
One such holding is ContextLogic, Inc. ContextLogic is what remains of the former Wish.
com, a former e-commerce highflyer that crashed and was sold for scraps. Following the
sale of its operating subsidiary, ContextLogic has a large pot of cash, minimal liabilities, and
enormous net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which can be used to offset future taxable
income. ContextLogic has partnered with large global alternative investment firm BC Partners
to find potential acquisitions. BC has invested $75 million in convertible preferred shares of
a ContextLogic subsidiary and has the right to invest another $75 million on the same terms.
Assuming BC exercises its rights, ContextLogic has just over $6.50 per share in cash with which to
pursue an acquisition. If ContextLogic can find the right acquisition and execute well, its tax assets
alone could be worth >100% of its current market capitalization.
This is not our first time investing in an “NOL shell.” We have also tracked a good number of
NOL shells over the years and we have seen what does and does not result in good outcomes. To
succeed with an NOL monetization strategy, the NOL shell must have the following:
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

1. Long-lived NOLs, and the more the better. If most of a company’s NOLs expire in just
a few years, the company is incentivized to make any deal it can, not the right deal for
shareholders. ContextLogic has $2 billion of federal NOLs that do not expire.
2. Adequate cash and a low burn rate. Under-capitalized NOL shells risk blowing through their
cash before identifying an acquisition. ContextLogic currently has $222 million in cash on
hand and a very low burn rate. Overhead costs are mostly offset by interest income.
3. Dealflow. Doing a good acquisition is hard, and it is harder without access to opportunities.
ContextLogic’s partnership with BC Partners ensure that CEO Rishi Bajaj will get a lot of
“looks” at potential acquisition targets.
We were able to buy a reasonable number of ContextLogic shares from forced sellers following
the company’s delisting from the NASDAQ. Even now, with shares rebounding, buyers are paying
very little for the tax assets. Our downside is well-protected by the company’s balance sheet cash.
If ContextLogic is unable to complete an acquisition on reasonable timeline, the company will
liquidate.
In addition to ContextLogic, we are actively increasing our holdings in liquidation scenarios and
other special situations. These will provide some portfolio “ballast” in the event the market’s mood
turns sour.
In Summary
We are having a very good year. I do not know if the good times will continue, but I am as excited
as ever about our collection of securities. They are both deeply undervalued and well off the radar
of most investors. The market may have a difficult time getting excited about SigmaRoc’s lime or
Seneca Foods’ canned Lima beans, but I have found that given enough time, the market does

The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%. Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%, respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by 0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses. Q3 ‘24 ’24 YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -0.1% 4.8% 1,094.9% 14.1% NASDAQ 2.5% 21.1% 684.3% 11.6% S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 21.9% 536.7% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 9.0% 14.1% 492.2% 10.0% Russell 2000 0.7% 11.2% 306.0% 7.8% Russell Microcap 8.3% 7.4% 200.2% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869 as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which we discuss further below. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund. All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89 per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36 in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1% in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid out last week. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share, an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of 2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were $589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under $6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81 per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of September should be approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings, net of cash. We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone! If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12 per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share. Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction, or additional lawsuits. The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC, and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed unitholders: The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator, PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased PCEC in 2019. The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter. Basically, as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the operator. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in 2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time. On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues. First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator, PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place. Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3 million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31, 2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used, unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to $0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC, on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production; however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully transfers it to the Trust. In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during production months while the Trust was in operation. Assessing the full ARO would be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past (prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest). If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of the wells. What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced. Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing. We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged to the Trust. So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned. Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other 1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a 5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds 6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds 7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap. The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months. Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly 20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts). Expected Change in Fund Administrator The fund has used Unkar Systems for a number of years as administrator. We were recently notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of year end. We are working on finding a replacement administrator. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
For the first time in a while, the NASDAQ was not the best performing of the major indices.
The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%.
Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%,
respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by
0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘24 ’24 YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek -0.1% 4.8% 1,094.9% 14.1%
NASDAQ 2.5% 21.1% 684.3% 11.6%
S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 21.9% 536.7% 10.4%
DJIA (DIA) 9.0% 14.1% 492.2% 10.0%
Russell 2000 0.7% 11.2% 306.0% 7.8%
Russell Microcap 8.3% 7.4% 200.2% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869
as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell
MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at
8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5
times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return
on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no
major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL), which we discuss further below.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are
each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our
expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89
per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at
$0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share
at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit
and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36
in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is
an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in
the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the
company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year
quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1%
in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our bank holdings as excess cash.

October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share,
which was paid out last week.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second
quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release
for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share,
an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by
10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first
six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of
2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP
preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run
rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible
bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder
friendly.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of
2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were
$589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second
quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue
that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000
parts.
ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under
$6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81
per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their
plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses.
Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third
quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In
October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating
margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per
share annualized.3 Net cash and investments at the end of September should be
approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings,
net of cash.
We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten
times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That
valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone!
If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today
with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by
the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12
per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share.
Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase.
3 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.

Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the
quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval
to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023.
Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits
for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on
quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers
were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction,
or additional lawsuits.
The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC,
and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed
unitholders:4
1. The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as
fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator,
PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased
PCEC in 2019.
The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance
Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that
4 We are not lawyers but these are issues that seem to us should be addressed. There may well be
additional items we are unaware of.

apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter.5 Basically,
as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded
the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what
document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over
misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the
operator.
2. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in
2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such
that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee
has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far.
3. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value
of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The
Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs
incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased
the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time.
On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time
thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can
be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues.
First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion
is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual
on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties
were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further
the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have
accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator,
PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place.
Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million
accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred
or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3
million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we
know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment
by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31,
2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time
resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to
assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all
the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly
wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used,
5 From our reading it appears PCEC and the Trustee used the language of Article II, Section 2.2 (a)
and (n) which read:
The problem is that the main paragraph limits how Section 2.2 (a) and (n) can be applied. We
believe PCEC and the Trustee ignored the limitations.

unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to
$0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place.
4. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC,
on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears
to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned
to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They
seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds
less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is
accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production;
however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to
retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully
transfers it to the Trust.
In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The
Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during
production months while the Trust was in operation.6 Assessing the full ARO would
be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past
(prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue
interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest).
If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the
worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a
revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of
the wells.
What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think
that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced.
Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is
not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing.
We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator
or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged
to the Trust.
So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going
to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers
would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the
ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned.
Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other
1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a
5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds
6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated7 $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds
7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds
6 Conveyance Agreement says cannot include costs that “attributable to a production month that
occurs prior to the Effective Time.” It doesn’t specifically address future costs because there would be
no reason to as they would obviously be excluded.
7 We have no idea the historical production for the properties. PCEC purchased the properties
between 1993 and 2004. We guessed the Trust received 30% of total historical production, but it
may well be a fraction of that.

Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds
exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders
only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap.
The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add
to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV)
was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight.
As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to
$3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share
after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend
since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly
20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).
Expected Change in Fund Administrator
The fund has used Unkar Systems for a number of years as administrator. We were recently
notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of year end. We are working on finding
a replacement administrator.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%. Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%, respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by 0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses. Q3 ‘24 ’24 YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -0.1% 4.8% 1,094.9% 14.1% NASDAQ 2.5% 21.1% 684.3% 11.6% S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 21.9% 536.7% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 9.0% 14.1% 492.2% 10.0% Russell 2000 0.7% 11.2% 306.0% 7.8% Russell Microcap 8.3% 7.4% 200.2% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869 as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which we discuss further below. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund. All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89 per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36 in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1% in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid out last week. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share, an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of 2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were $589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under $6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81 per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of September should be approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings, net of cash. We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone! If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12 per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share. Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction, or additional lawsuits. The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC, and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed unitholders: The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator, PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased PCEC in 2019. The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter. Basically, as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the operator. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in 2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time. On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues. First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator, PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place. Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3 million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31, 2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used, unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to $0.45 per unit.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
For the first time in a while, the NASDAQ was not the best performing of the major indices.
The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%.
Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%,
respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by
0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘24 ’24 YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek -0.1% 4.8% 1,094.9% 14.1%
NASDAQ 2.5% 21.1% 684.3% 11.6%
S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 21.9% 536.7% 10.4%
DJIA (DIA) 9.0% 14.1% 492.2% 10.0%
Russell 2000 0.7% 11.2% 306.0% 7.8%
Russell Microcap 8.3% 7.4% 200.2% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869
as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell
MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at
8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5
times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return
on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no
major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL), which we discuss further below.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are
each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our
expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89
per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at
$0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share
at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit
and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36
in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is
an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in
the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the
company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year
quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1%
in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our bank holdings as excess cash.

October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share,
which was paid out last week.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second
quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release
for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share,
an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by
10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first
six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of
2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP
preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run
rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible
bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder
friendly.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of
2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were
$589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second
quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue
that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000
parts.
ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under
$6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81
per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their
plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses.
Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third
quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In
October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating
margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per
share annualized.3 Net cash and investments at the end of September should be
approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings,
net of cash.
We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten
times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That
valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone!
If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today
with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by
the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12
per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share.
Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase.
3 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.

Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the
quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval
to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023.
Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits
for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on
quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers
were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction,
or additional lawsuits.
The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC,
and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed
unitholders:4
1. The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as
fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator,
PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased
PCEC in 2019.
The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance
Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that
4 We are not lawyers but these are issues that seem to us should be addressed. There may well be
additional items we are unaware of.

apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter.5 Basically,
as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded
the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what
document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over
misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the
operator.
2. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in
2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such
that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee
has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far.
3. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value
of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The
Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs
incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased
the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time.
On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time
thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can
be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues.
First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion
is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual
on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties
were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further
the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have
accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator,
PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place.
Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million
accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred
or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3
million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we
know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment
by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31,
2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time
resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to
assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all
the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly
wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used,
5 From our reading it appears PCEC and the Trustee used the language of Article II, Section 2.2 (a)
and (n) which read:
The problem is that the main paragraph limits how Section 2.2 (a) and (n) can be applied. We
believe PCEC and the Trustee ignored the limitations.

unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to
$0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place.
4. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC,
on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears
to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned
to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They
seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds
less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is
accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production;
however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to
retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully
transfers it to the Trust.
In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The
Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during
production months while the Trust was in operation.6 Assessing the full ARO would
be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past
(prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue
interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest).
If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the
worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a
revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of
the wells.
What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think
that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced.
Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is
not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing.
We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator
or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged
to the Trust.
So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going
to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers
would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the
ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned.
Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other
1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a
5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds
6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated7 $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds
7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds
6 Conveyance Agreement says cannot include costs that “attributable to a production month that
occurs prior to the Effective Time.” It doesn’t specifically address future costs because there would be
no reason to as they would obviously be excluded.
7 We have no idea the historical production for the properties. PCEC purchased the properties
between 1993 and 2004. We guessed the Trust received 30% of total historical production, but it
may well be a fraction of that.

Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds
exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders
only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap.
The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add
to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV)
was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight.
As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to
$3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share
after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend
since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly
20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).
Expected Change in Fund Administrator
The fund has used Unkar Systems for a number of years as administrator. We were recently
notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of year end. We are working on finding
a replacement administrator.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The market continued to be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns in excess of 26% and the S&P 500 to 13.0%. The Russell 2000 was up only 2.5% and the Russell MicroCap index was down 5.8% year-to-date. Cedar Creek increased by 12.5% in the third quarter, and was up 16.7% for the first nine months of 2023, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 ¾-year history is 14.5%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses. Q3 ‘23 YTD ’23 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 12.5% 16.7% 1,006.6% 14.5% NASDAQ -4.1% 26.3% 470.5% 10.3% S&P 500 (SPY) -3.2% 13.0% 368.0% 9.1% DJIA (DIA) -2.0% 2.7% 358.7% 9.0% Russell 2000 -5.1% 2.5% 220.3% 3.8% Russell Microcap -7.9% -5.8% 140.9% 5.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,106,601 as of September 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $240,885 in the Russell Micro Cap and $570,526 in the NASDAQ. 1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 6.2 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5.1 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 9.4 times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), and under 8 times assuming the ARO assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned roughly $0.20 per unit in the last twelve months. Weighted price to book was 1.7. Dividend yield was 1.8%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2023, was 27%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 5%. We continued to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and a couple of other smaller names that we are building positions in. PD-Rx is on the expert market and trades at three times trailing earnings, and just over one times earnings net of cash. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased modestly in the quarter, due to an increase in the market price of Propel Media (PROM) which we profiled in our Q2 letter. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 37% exposure to the expert market and ended at 39% of the fund. Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 17.5% of the fund, due to it rising in price from $0.23 to $1.10 per share in the quarter, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 9% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4.5% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link). Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings Propel Media (PROM) – as we noted above was profiled in our Q2 letter and trades on the expert market. It rose in price from $0.23 per share to $1.10 per share during the quarter. The acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) is being held up at the FTC. Hearings are scheduled for December. We were pleasantly surprised in the quarter that Propel declared a dividend of $0.01376 per share. The dividend was nearly 6% of our purchase price, which was nice. What was more important was that it provided confirmation of profitability for Propel and that it was likely earning cash in excess of any working capital targets that were set at the time of the agreement to sell to IQVIA. Current market cap is approximately $275 million. The potential acquisition of Propel by IQVIA is believed to be between $700 and $800 million. 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We used a projection of $0.15 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust. If courts rule against claims of unitholders and actual earnings are zero, then the fund’s holdings are trading at 6.9 times our estimates of earnings for the coming year, and 5.6 times net of cash at the respective businesses. PharmChem (PCHM) became the largest position in the fund due to a contribution in kind to the fund by Tice Brown the former Chairman of the Board of PharmChem. The transaction was announced August 31, 2023. As part of the transaction, Mr. Brown resigned from the Board and I took his place as Chairman. The fund previously owned about 3% of PharmChem. After the transaction, the fund is the largest shareholder, owning 31% of the company. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.47 to $0.455 per unit in the quarter. The special meeting was held on July 12. 96% of unitholders voting supported removal of Bank of New York Mellon as trustee. 93% of those who voted supported allocating the costs to the Trust instead of having them borne by the group who called the Special Meeting; however, it needed 75% of all units outstanding to be in favor and it only achieved 59% due to the 66% turnout. We were very pleased with the result. It was an important first step and we look forward to unitholders being better represented and ultimately being treated fairly, which we do not think is currently happening. An arbitration decision was announced recently which provided mixed results – PCEC was allowed to assess legal fees to the Trust up through liquidation but not against proceeds from a sale, while Bank of New York Mellon was allowed to insist on waiting for completion of the Trust’s audits for the last four years before putting the net profit interest up for sale. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them up until now. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing the delay. The recent increase in oil prices was also a positive event. It allows for faster repayment of the ARO that has been assessed by PCEC. In a worst case situation of dissolution it should result in a higher valuation for the net profits interest. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 7% in the third quarter of 2023 from $10.70 per share to $10.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron closed its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. 2022 revenue was approximately $5.9 million with operating income of $1.3 million, as compared to 2021 revenue of $5.5 million and operating income of $1,2 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we filed a Form 4 noting the fund purchased an additional 35,000 shares for $10.70 per share in a private transaction. The share price increased to as high as $12 per share after the filing of the fund’s purchase. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first quarter of 2023 were roughly $1.70 per share. Second quarter earnings increased to roughly $1.85 per share. We believe the current annualized earnings run rate is approximately $7 per share, which is quite low in relation to its $34 share price. We think the market is incorrect in giving almost no value to the massive amount of low rate perpetual preferred stock issued to the government.3 At $34 the stock is below book value and less than five times earnings. BankFirst (BFCC) purchased a bank that had ECIP preferred stock and in the transaction valued it at 21 cents on the dollar. If we value Citizens 3 The maximum rate on the preferred is 2%. If the bank an increase lending the rate can decline to between 0.5% and 2.0%. preferred at 25 cents on the dollar, it would increase book value by $72 million, or more than 100%. Higher interest rates make the preferred worth even less than what BankFirst valued the preferred in its acquisition. We think the stock is worth more than twice the current price. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all were negative in the third quarter. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns
in excess of 26% and the S&P 500 to 13.0%. The Russell 2000 was up only 2.5% and the
Russell MicroCap index was down 5.8% year-to-date. Cedar Creek increased by 12.5% in
the third quarter, and was up 16.7% for the first nine months of 2023, net of fees and
expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 ¾-year history is 14.5%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘23 YTD ’23 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 12.5% 16.7% 1,006.6% 14.5%
NASDAQ -4.1% 26.3% 470.5% 10.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) -3.2% 13.0% 368.0% 9.1%
DJIA (DIA) -2.0% 2.7% 358.7% 9.0%
Russell 2000 -5.1% 2.5% 220.3% 3.8%
Russell Microcap -7.9% -5.8% 140.9% 5.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,106,601
as of September 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indices we compare against would have only grown to between $240,885 in the Russell Micro
Cap and $570,526 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at
6.2 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5.1 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 9.4
times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), and under 8 times
assuming the ARO assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned roughly $0.20 per
unit in the last twelve months. Weighted price to book was 1.7. Dividend yield was 1.8%.
Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2023, was 27%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 5%. We continued
to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and a couple of other smaller
names that we are building positions in. PD-Rx is on the expert market and trades at three

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

An arbitration decision was announced recently which provided mixed results – PCEC was allowed to assess legal fees to the Trust up through liquidation but not against proceeds from a sale, while Bank of New York Mellon was allowed to insist on waiting for completion of the Trust’s audits for the last four years before putting the net profit interest up for sale. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them up until now. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing the delay. The recent increase in oil prices was also a positive event. It allows for faster repayment of the ARO that has been assessed by PCEC. In a worst case situation of dissolution it should result in a higher valuation for the net profits interest. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 7% in the third quarter of 2023 from $10.70 per share to $10.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron closed its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. 2022 revenue was approximately $5.9 million with operating income of $1.3 million, as compared to 2021 revenue of $5.5 million and operating income of $1,2 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we filed a Form 4 noting the fund purchased an additional 35,000 shares for $10.70 per share in a private transaction. The share price increased to as high as $12 per share after the filing of the fund’s purchase. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first quarter of 2023 were roughly $1.70 per share. Second quarter earnings increased to roughly $1.85 per share. We believe the current annualized earnings run rate is approximately $7 per share, which is quite low in relation to its $34 share price. We think the market is incorrect in giving almost no value to the massive amount of low rate perpetual preferred stock issued to the government.3 At $34 the stock is below book value and less than five times earnings. BankFirst (BFCC) purchased a bank that had ECIP preferred stock and in the transaction valued it at 21 cents on the dollar. If we value Citizens 3 The maximum rate on the preferred is 2%. If the bank an increase lending the rate can decline to between 0.5% and 2.0%. preferred at 25 cents on the dollar, it would increase book value by $72 million, or more than 100%. Higher interest rates make the preferred worth even less than what BankFirst valued the preferred in its acquisition. We think the stock is worth more than twice the current price. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all were negative in the third quarter. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns
in excess of 26% and the S&P 500 to 13.0%. The Russell 2000 was up only 2.5% and the
Russell MicroCap index was down 5.8% year-to-date. Cedar Creek increased by 12.5% in
the third quarter, and was up 16.7% for the first nine months of 2023, net of fees and
expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 ¾-year history is 14.5%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘23 YTD ’23 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 12.5% 16.7% 1,006.6% 14.5%
NASDAQ -4.1% 26.3% 470.5% 10.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) -3.2% 13.0% 368.0% 9.1%
DJIA (DIA) -2.0% 2.7% 358.7% 9.0%
Russell 2000 -5.1% 2.5% 220.3% 3.8%
Russell Microcap -7.9% -5.8% 140.9% 5.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,106,601
as of September 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indices we compare against would have only grown to between $240,885 in the Russell Micro
Cap and $570,526 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at
6.2 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5.1 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 9.4
times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), and under 8 times
assuming the ARO assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned roughly $0.20 per
unit in the last twelve months. Weighted price to book was 1.7. Dividend yield was 1.8%.
Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2023, was 27%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 8% and ended the quarter at 5%. We continued
to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and a couple of other smaller
names that we are building positions in. PD-Rx is on the expert market and trades at three
times trailing earnings, and just over one times earnings net of cash.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased modestly in the quarter, due
to an increase in the market price of Propel Media (PROM) which we profiled in our Q2
letter. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those
unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting
companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending
on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 37%
exposure to the expert market and ended at 39% of the fund.
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 17.5% of the fund, due to it rising in price from $0.23 to $1.10 per share in the
quarter, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 9% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil
Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4.5% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in
our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more
detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link).
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Propel Media (PROM) – as we noted above was profiled in our Q2 letter and trades on the
expert market. It rose in price from $0.23 per share to $1.10 per share during the quarter.
The acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) is being held up at the FTC. Hearings are scheduled
for December. We were pleasantly surprised in the quarter that Propel declared a dividend
of $0.01376 per share. The dividend was nearly 6% of our purchase price, which was nice.
What was more important was that it provided confirmation of profitability for Propel and that
it was likely earning cash in excess of any working capital targets that were set at the time
of the agreement to sell to IQVIA. Current market cap is approximately $275 million. The
potential acquisition of Propel by IQVIA is believed to be between $700 and $800 million.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We used
a projection of $0.15 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust. If courts rule against claims of unitholders and
actual earnings are zero, then the fund’s holdings are trading at 6.9 times our estimates of earnings for the coming
year, and 5.6 times net of cash at the respective businesses.

PharmChem (PCHM) became the largest position in the fund due to a contribution in kind
to the fund by Tice Brown the former Chairman of the Board of PharmChem. The transaction
was announced August 31, 2023. As part of the transaction, Mr. Brown resigned from the
Board and I took his place as Chairman. The fund previously owned about 3% of PharmChem.
After the transaction, the fund is the largest shareholder, owning 31% of the company.
PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to
urine testing.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.47 to $0.455 per unit in the
quarter. The special meeting was held on July 12. 96% of unitholders voting supported
removal of Bank of New York Mellon as trustee. 93% of those who voted supported allocating
the costs to the Trust instead of having them borne by the group who called the Special
Meeting; however, it needed 75% of all units outstanding to be in favor and it only achieved
59% due to the 66% turnout. We were very pleased with the result. It was an important
first step and we look forward to unitholders being better represented and ultimately being
treated fairly, which we do not think is currently happening.
An arbitration decision was announced recently which provided mixed results – PCEC was
allowed to assess legal fees to the Trust up through liquidation but not against proceeds from
a sale, while Bank of New York Mellon was allowed to insist on waiting for completion of the
Trust’s audits for the last four years before putting the net profit interest up for sale. We
don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them up until now. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices was also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the ARO that has been assessed by PCEC. In a worst case situation of
dissolution it should result in a higher valuation for the net profits interest.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 7% in the third quarter of
2023 from $10.70 per share to $10.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron closed its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI).
MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. 2022 revenue was
approximately $5.9 million with operating income of $1.3 million, as compared to 2021
revenue of $5.5 million and operating income of $1,2 million. Subsequent to quarter end,
we filed a Form 4 noting the fund purchased an additional 35,000 shares for $10.70 per share
in a private transaction. The share price increased to as high as $12 per share after the filing
of the fund’s purchase.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file

We think the market is incorrect in giving almost no value to the massive amount of low rate

preferred at 25 cents on the dollar, it would increase book value by $72 million, or more than
100%. Higher interest rates make the preferred worth even less than what BankFirst valued
the preferred in its acquisition. We think the stock is worth more than twice the current price.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have

The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%. Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%, respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by 0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence.

Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which we discuss further below. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund. All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89 per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36 in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1% in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our bank holdings as excess cash. October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid out last week. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share, an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of 2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were $589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under $6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81 per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per share annualized.3 Net cash and investments at the end of September should be approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings, net of cash. We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone! If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12 per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share. Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase. 3 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction, or additional lawsuits. The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC, and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed unitholders:4 1. The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator, PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased PCEC in 2019. The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that 4 We are not lawyers but these are issues that seem to us should be addressed. There may well be additional items we are unaware of. apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter.5 Basically, as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the operator. 2. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in 2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far. 3. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time. On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues. First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator, PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place. Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3 million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31, 2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used, 5 From our reading it appears PCEC and the Trustee used the language of Article II, Section 2.2 (a) and (n) which read: The problem is that the main paragraph limits how Section 2.2 (a) and (n) can be applied. We believe PCEC and the Trustee ignored the limitations. unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to $0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place. 4. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC, on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production; however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully transfers it to the Trust. In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during production months while the Trust was in operation.6 Assessing the full ARO would be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past (prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest). If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of the wells. What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced. Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing. We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged to the Trust. So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned. Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other 1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a 5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds 6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated7 $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds 7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds 6 Conveyance Agreement says cannot include costs that “attributable to a production month that occurs prior to the Effective Time.” It doesn’t specifically address future costs because there would be no reason to as they would obviously be excluded. 7 We have no idea the historical production for the properties. PCEC purchased the properties between 1993 and 2004. We guessed the Trust received 30% of total historical production, but it may well be a fraction of that. Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap. The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months. Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly 20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts).

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
For the first time in a while, the NASDAQ was not the best performing of the major indices.
The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%.
Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%,
respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by
0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘24 ’24 YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek -0.1% 4.8% 1,094.9% 14.1%
NASDAQ 2.5% 21.1% 684.3% 11.6%
S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 21.9% 536.7% 10.4%
DJIA (DIA) 9.0% 14.1% 492.2% 10.0%
Russell 2000 0.7% 11.2% 306.0% 7.8%
Russell Microcap 8.3% 7.4% 200.2% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869
as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell
MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at
8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5
times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return
on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no
major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL), which we discuss further below.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are
each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our
expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89
per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at
$0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share
at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit
and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36
in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is
an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in
the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the
company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year
quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1%
in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our bank holdings as excess cash.

October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share,
which was paid out last week.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second
quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release
for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share,
an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by
10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first
six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of
2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP
preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run
rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible
bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder
friendly.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of
2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were
$589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second
quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue
that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000
parts.
ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under
$6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81
per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their
plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses.
Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third
quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In
October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating
margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per
share annualized.3 Net cash and investments at the end of September should be
approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings,
net of cash.
We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten
times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That
valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone!
If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today
with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by
the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12
per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share.
Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase.
3 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.

Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the
quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval
to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023.
Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits
for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on
quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers
were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction,
or additional lawsuits.
The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC,
and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed
unitholders:4
1. The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as
fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator,
PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased
PCEC in 2019.
The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance
Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that
4 We are not lawyers but these are issues that seem to us should be addressed. There may well be
additional items we are unaware of.

apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter.5 Basically,
as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded
the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what
document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over
misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the
operator.
2. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in
2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such
that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee
has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far.
3. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value
of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The
Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs
incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased
the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time.
On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time
thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can
be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues.
First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion
is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual
on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties
were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further
the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have
accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator,
PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place.
Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million
accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred
or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3
million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we
know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment
by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31,
2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time
resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to
assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all
the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly
wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used,
5 From our reading it appears PCEC and the Trustee used the language of Article II, Section 2.2 (a)
and (n) which read:
The problem is that the main paragraph limits how Section 2.2 (a) and (n) can be applied. We
believe PCEC and the Trustee ignored the limitations.

unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to
$0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place.
4. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC,
on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears
to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned
to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They
seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds
less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is
accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production;
however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to
retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully
transfers it to the Trust.
In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The
Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during
production months while the Trust was in operation.6 Assessing the full ARO would
be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past
(prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue
interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest).
If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the
worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a
revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of
the wells.
What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think
that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced.
Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is
not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing.
We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator
or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged
to the Trust.
So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going
to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers
would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the
ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned.
Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other
1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a
5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds
6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated7 $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds
7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds
6 Conveyance Agreement says cannot include costs that “attributable to a production month that
occurs prior to the Effective Time.” It doesn’t specifically address future costs because there would be
no reason to as they would obviously be excluded.
7 We have no idea the historical production for the properties. PCEC purchased the properties
between 1993 and 2004. We guessed the Trust received 30% of total historical production, but it
may well be a fraction of that.

Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds
exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders
only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap.
The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add
to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV)
was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight.
As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to
$3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share
after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend
since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly
20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).
Expected Change in Fund Administrator
The fund has used Unkar Systems for a number of years as administrator. We were recently
notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of year end. We are working on finding
a replacement administrator.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%. Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%, respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by 0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses. Q3 ‘24 ’24 YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -0.1% 4.8% 1,094.9% 14.1% NASDAQ 2.5% 21.1% 684.3% 11.6% S&P 500 (SPY) 5.4% 21.9% 536.7% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 9.0% 14.1% 492.2% 10.0% Russell 2000 0.7% 11.2% 306.0% 7.8% Russell Microcap 8.3% 7.4% 200.2% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869 as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ. 1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which we discuss further below. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders. Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund. All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89 per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at $0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36 in the third quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Second quarter earnings were $0.123 per share. Results in the quarter benefitted from a reversal in stock option expense. Excluding that benefit the company would have earned $0.079 per share versus $0.036 per share in the prior year quarter. More importantly, patch sales, excluding our former top customer, increased 7.1% in the first six months of the year, while screens, which lag patch sales, increased 2.2%. On 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our bank holdings as excess cash. October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid out last week. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share, an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of 2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were $589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000 parts. ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under $6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81 per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per share annualized.3 Net cash and investments at the end of September should be approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings, net of cash. We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone! If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12 per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share. Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase. 3 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction, or additional lawsuits. The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC, and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed unitholders:4 1. The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator, PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased PCEC in 2019. The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that 4 We are not lawyers but these are issues that seem to us should be addressed. There may well be additional items we are unaware of. apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter.5 Basically, as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the operator. 2. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in 2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far. 3. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time. On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues. First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator, PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place. Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3 million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31, 2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used, 5 From our reading it appears PCEC and the Trustee used the language of Article II, Section 2.2 (a) and (n) which read: The problem is that the main paragraph limits how Section 2.2 (a) and (n) can be applied. We believe PCEC and the Trustee ignored the limitations. unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to $0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place. 4. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC, on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production; however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully transfers it to the Trust. In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during production months while the Trust was in operation.6 Assessing the full ARO would be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past (prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest). If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of the wells. What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced. Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing. We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged to the Trust. So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned. Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other 1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a 4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a 5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds 6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated7 $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds 7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds 6 Conveyance Agreement says cannot include costs that “attributable to a production month that occurs prior to the Effective Time.” It doesn’t specifically address future costs because there would be no reason to as they would obviously be excluded. 7 We have no idea the historical production for the properties. PCEC purchased the properties between 1993 and 2004. We guessed the Trust received 30% of total historical production, but it may well be a fraction of that. Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap. The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months. Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly 20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our thoughts). Expected Change in Fund Administrator The fund has used Unkar Systems for a number of years as administrator. We were recently notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of year end. We are working on finding a replacement administrator. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
For the first time in a while, the NASDAQ was not the best performing of the major indices.
The DJIA rose 9.0% in the quarter, the Russell MicroCap rose 8.3%, and the S&P 500 5.4%.
Year to date the S&P500 edged past the NASDAQ with gains of 21.9% and 21.1%,
respectively. Other indices while positive lagged well behind. Cedar Creek decreased by
0.1% in the third quarter, and was up 4.8% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.1%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,097.6%, net of fees and expenses.

$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,194,869
as of September 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indices we compare against would have only grown to between $300,205 in the Russell
MicroCap and $784,320 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at
8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.5
times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 3.6%. Weighted expected return
on equity as of September 30, 2024, was 16.0%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the quarter at 3%. Ther were no
major sales in the quarter. We continued to purchase units in Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL), which we discuss further below.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 28% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also

There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders.
Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login.
Others mail annual results out to shareholders but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(PROM) is about 8% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC (FIEB) are
each about 5%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
All of the fund’s underperformance this year is due to the decline in the valuation of our
expert market holdings. At the beginning of the year, Propel was valued at last sale of $0.89
per share. As of September 30, 2024, it was valued based on a dividend discount model at
$0.525 per share. PD-Rx was valued at $7 at the beginning of the year and $3.56 per share
at the end of the third quarter. Pacific Coast Oil Trust started the year at $0.415 per unit
and was valued at $0.28 per unit as of September 30, 2024.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $3.32 per share to $3.36

2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our bank holdings as excess cash.

October 1, 2024, PharmChem announced payment of a special dividend of $0.25 per share,
which was paid out last week.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price increased from $45.45 per share at the end of the second
quarter to $51.25 per share at the end of the third quarter. Citizens issued a press release
for second quarter results. Earnings for the second quarter of 2024 were $2.11 per share,
an increase of 17% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by
10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. Earnings for the first
six months of 2024 were $4.06 per share versus $3.49 per share in the first six months of
2023. Starting in the third quarter they will be paying a 2% annual rate on their ECIP
preferred, which will reduce quarterly earnings by $0.27 per share. Annualized earnings run
rate after preferred stock expense is roughly $7.50 per share. The stock is an incredible
bargain at seven times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder
friendly.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the third quarter of
2024 from $18.00 per share to $17.61 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter Solitron released fiscal first quarter results. Earnings were
$589,000 or $0.28 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fiscal second
quarter results. Earnings were Solitron $17,000 or $0.01 per share due to a supplier issue
that resulted in both a loss of revenue and increased costs from scrapping of over 2,000
parts.
ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in our 2024 first quarter letter. The share price was under
$6.50 when we profiled it. During the third quarter the bid price declined from $7.96 to $7.81
per share despite continued improvement in the business. They continue to execute on their
plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management which will reduce expenses.
Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew an impressive 10% in the third
quarter from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. That is sequential growth , not year over year. In
October they started a new fund – Nordic High Income fund. Assuming 40% cash operating
margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.28 per share, or $1.12 per
share annualized.3 Net cash and investments at the end of September should be
approximately $1.90 per share, meaning the stock is trading at just over six times earnings,
net of cash.
We wrote in our first quarter letter that we thought shares of ENDI were worth eight to ten
times current earnings plus net cash, or $9.75 to $11.50 per share by year end. That
valuation estimate was based on no growth – yet they grew 10% in the third quarter alone!
If we used the same no growth valuation it would equate to $11.00 to $13.00 per share today
with that value increasing $0.25 to $0.30 per share every quarter due to earnings. Thus, by
the end of the year, fair value would be $11.25 to $13.50 per share assuming the same $1.12
per share annual earnings run rate and year-end cash balance of ~$2.30 per share.
Obviously if revenue and earnings continue to grow the valuation estimate will increase.
3 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.

Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.31 to $0.28 per unit in the
quarter. As we mentioned each of the last two quarters, the trustee received court approval
to delay a sale of the interests and liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023.
Nearly a year has since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits
for those years, although language in their monthly press releases imply they are working on
quarterly information for the audit which should only happen once the year end numbers
were finished. Thus, it may be close, which could result in the properties going up for auction,
or additional lawsuits.
The reason we say additional lawsuits is that to date it appears to us that the operator, PCEC,
and the Trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, have made a number of errors that have harmed
unitholders:4
1. The initial Offering Prospectus presented the asset retirement obligation (ARO) as
fully remaining with the operator (e.g., page PCEC F-30 shown below). The operator,
PCEC, followed this practice for seven years until a new ownership group purchased
PCEC in 2019.
The operator argues, and the Trustee has apparently agreed, that the Conveyance
Agreement language allows for assessment of the ARO to the Trust and that
4 We are not lawyers but these are issues that seem to us should be addressed. There may well be
additional items we are unaware of.

apparently what was presented in the Offering Prospectus doesn’t matter.5 Basically,
as we understand it, they are arguing that the Conveyance Agreement superseded
the Offering Prospectus. This seems a weak argument to us. Regardless of what
document supersedes, we think the Trustee had a fiduciary duty to file suit over
misrepresentations in the Prospectus showing the ARO fully remaining with the
operator.
2. PCEC declined to assess ARO from 2012 up through the ownership change in
2019. Are they allowed to change their position and assess ARO retroactively such
that it causes distributions to stop and triggers an auction of the assets? The Trustee
has allowed them to, and the courts have apparently agreed so far.
3. Most of the ARO assessment relates to accretion - the change in the present value
of future liabilities (in this case, plugging wells) due to the passage of time. The
Conveyance Agreement only allows the operator to charge the Trust for costs
incurred or accrued from and after the Effective Time (the time the Trust purchased
the net profits interest) that relates to production occurring after the Effective Time.
On the developed properties the ARO was already accrued prior to the Effective Time
thus it cannot be accrued to the Trust. Only actual costs incurred for plugging can
be, which it is our understanding is negligible. This results in a couple of issues.
First, it is not spelled out whether accretion can be assessed to the Trust. Accretion
is not really a new accrual. If it cannot be assessed to the Trust then no ARO accrual
on the developed properties can be, since, by definition, all the developed properties
were already developed and had ARO accrued for, as required under GAAP. Further
the $22.3 million the operator accrued for as of December 31, 2021, would have
accreted to roughly $54 million today – more than the $49.8 million the operator,
PCEC, is claiming for ARO. The Trustee has allowed this to take place.
Second, even if accretion can be assessed to the Trust, the original $22.3 million
accrual cannot be. The Conveyance Agreement expressly says only costs incurred
or accrued by the Grantor “from and after the Effective Time” can be. The $22.3
million ARO was accrued by the Grantor prior to the Effective Time, and as far as we
know, no actual plugging costs have been incurred. This means that the assessment
by PCEC has to be reduced. The question is - By how much? Is it the December 31,
2011, $22.3 million figure? Or that figure plus accretion to the Effective Time
resulting in $22.7 million? Or should it accrete until the time of PCEC’s decision to
assess ARO as of December 31, 2019? Best we can tell, the Trustee has allowed all
the ARO and all the accretion to be assessed to the Trust. We believe this is clearly
wrong and had even the more “conservative” amount of $22.3 or $22.7 million used,
5 From our reading it appears PCEC and the Trustee used the language of Article II, Section 2.2 (a)
and (n) which read:
The problem is that the main paragraph limits how Section 2.2 (a) and (n) can be applied. We
believe PCEC and the Trustee ignored the limitations.

unitholders would be owed $16 to $18 million in distributions, or roughly $0.40 to
$0.45 per unit. The Trustee has apparently allowed this to take place.
4. It is theoretically possible that the Courts could rule in favor of the operator, PCEC,
on all the above points but there is still another major issue. The Trustee appears
to be taking the position that the assessed ARO to date does not have to be returned
to unitholders along with the auction proceeds, net of any remaining costs. They
seem to be communicating in the monthly 8-K filings that only the auction proceeds
less certain costs will be returned. We believe this is completely wrong. ARO is
accrued on the books of the owner at the time a well is brought into production;
however, it transfers to the buyer when a property is sold unless the seller chose to
retain it, as we believe PCEC did. Nothing in the Conveyance Agreement fully
transfers it to the Trust.
In fact, PCEC and the Trustee’s approach violates the Conveyance Agreement. The
Conveyance Agreement limits accrued or incurred costs to those incurred during
production months while the Trust was in operation.6 Assessing the full ARO would
be assessing for costs that incurred during the whole historical life of the wells – past
(prior to the Trust having a revenue interest), present (while it has/had a revenue
interest), and indefinitely into the future (when it no longer has a revenue interest).
If any assessment was ultimately allowed, and we don’t think it should, under the
worst case it must be calculated based on units of production while the Trust had a
revenue interest versus the total historical plus expected production for the life of
the wells.
What is clear is that this an extremely complex issue with a lot of moving parts, and we think
that complexity, along with its small size and limited liquidity, is why ROYTL is so mispriced.
Our view is that it is priced as if every decision will go against unitholders and that time is
not our friend. We think time is our friend because the ARO “balance” is clearly decreasing.
We would argue that if any errors or violations of the Conveyance Agreement by the operator
or Trustee are proven then much if not all of the $7 million in legal fees cannot be charged
to the Trust.
So what does this all mean? What are the possible outcomes and returns? We are not going
to attach probabilities to each scenario. It would be imprecise, and we think PCEC lawyers
would try and use anything we say against unitholders. As noted above, we do believe the
ARO should be fully returned to unitholders with interest if the trust is auctioned.
Possible Outcomes Refunded Distributions Other
1 ARO not assessable; distributions resume $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
2 ARO assessable limited to Remaining Properties $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
3 ARO assessable limited by $22.3 million + accretion $ 1.05 ~ $0.25 year n/a
4 ARO assessable limited by $22.3/$22.7 million $ 0.45 delayed ~ year n/a
5 ARO assessable; auction; ARO refunded $ 1.05 eliminated auction proceeds
6 ARO assessable; auction; ARO pro-rated7 $ $0.75 eliminated auction proceeds
7 ARO assessable; auction; ARO not refunded $ - eliminated auction proceeds
6 Conveyance Agreement says cannot include costs that “attributable to a production month that
occurs prior to the Effective Time.” It doesn’t specifically address future costs because there would be
no reason to as they would obviously be excluded.
7 We have no idea the historical production for the properties. PCEC purchased the properties
between 1993 and 2004. We guessed the Trust received 30% of total historical production, but it
may well be a fraction of that.

Compared to the current price of $0.23 per unit all the scenarios should result in proceeds
exceeding the current market price. Even the “worst case” of an auction where unitholders
only receive proceeds should result in bids of in excess of the current $9 million market cap.
The properties cash flow more than that in one year. All this to say, we were happy to add
to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January of this year the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV)
was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight.
As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to
$3.15 per Propel share. In June 2023, we were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share
after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel has paid a quarterly dividend
since August 2023. In total we have received over $0.045 per share in dividends, or nearly
20% of our purchase price. We expect another dividend in November.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).
Expected Change in Fund Administrator
The fund has used Unkar Systems for a number of years as administrator. We were recently
notified by Unkar that they plan to close operations as of year end. We are working on finding
a replacement administrator.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The ones that suffered the most in the first quarter increased the most in the second quarter. The NASDAQ rose 17.7% in Q2 after declining 10.4% in Q1, while the S&P500 rose 10.8% in Q2 after falling 4.3% in Q1. Cedar Creek was up 5.8% in the second quarter, compared to a gain of 8.7% in the first quarter, net of fees and expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 15.1%. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ½ year history is 14.45%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,281.0%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘25 Q1 ‘25 ‘25YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 5.8% 8.7% 15.1% 1,281.0% 14.4% NASDAQ 17.7% -10.4% 5.5% 779.1% 11.8% S&P 500 (SPY) 10.8% -4.3% 6.1% 592.0% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 5.4% -1.0% 4.4% 524.0% 9.9% Russell 2000 8.5% -9.5% -1.8% 300.1% 7.4% Russell Microcap 15.5% -14.4% -1.1% 214.4% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,380,992 as of June 30, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $314,382 in the Russell MicroCap and $879,127 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.4 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.8 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.7 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend yield was 2.5%. Weighted expected return on equity as of June 30, 2025, was 18.9%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3% largely due to the investment in CBE LLC, which we will discuss later. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 35% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders (unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund. As we noted last quarter, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares (MCBS) for cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from prior announcements which had said during the fourth quarter. There is still a large gap between expected proceeds and recent trades in First IC. Illiquidity seems to be the cause, not uncertainty on whether the deal will close. Subsequent to quarter end we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert: PHIG). As of today, it is nearly a 7% position. We think it is worth two to three times the most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services for the global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry. The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year. Performance Attribution Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities. Most of the fund’s performance in the second quarter was due to the increase in the valuation of our control positions. They increased 14% in aggregate in the quarter. Our expert market basket of stocks increased in value by just over 1% in the second quarter, while our generally undervalued securities increased 8%. Update on Propel Media Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15 per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked, we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. The fund’s valuation increased from $0.85 per share to $0.90 per share in the quarter. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous 10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In April of this year we received a dividend of just over $0.01 per share, much earlier than the normal 90 day interval. In total we have received over $0.086 per share in dividends, or 35% of our purchase price in two years (see chart). It has now been almost 100 days since the last dividend. Since Propel is a black box we do not know why the delay, but are not overly concerned about it. Last quarter we included another interesting data point we track - Propel’s level of borrowing and its loan capacity. Propel’s main business, DeepIntent, has an asset-based loan (ABL) facility with a publicly reporting company, SLR Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each quarter and also their unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed by DeepIntent but also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our understanding that most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s accounts receivable. It seems reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment terms on its accounts receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run rate. It would be the current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to 90% to give us total receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of receivables to 365 days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown in four columns of chart below).

DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error. What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150 million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80% from a year earlier. In the first quarter, revenue run rate appears to be between $230 and $304 million, an increase of 14% in the first quarter alone (last line of the chart). To say we are eagerly waiting to read SLR’s second quarter filing is an understatement. Update on Our Control Positions As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $14.28 per share to $15.75 per share during the second quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the fund manager owns 2.5% personally. While reported earnings have been soft the last few quarters due to lower revenues owing to timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing a material uptick in orders at the end of fiscal 2025. In the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two-year order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of $3.1 million. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. The order is believed to include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well, which is reportedly used, or intended to be used, to shoot down hypersonic missiles. In the first quarter ending May 31, 2025, bookings were $2.8 million versus sales of $2.7 million. We expect revenue to begin to reflect the higher backlog in the second quarter and fully reflect it in the third quarter. There continues to be strong domestic and foreign demand for both HIMARS and AMRAAM. The military has submitted an unfunded priorities list for a doubling in AMRAAM production by 2028 but any increase is up to Congress. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.20 per share to $3.75 in the second quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. On February 3, 2025 the Company announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release noted that PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. In its May 9, 2025, earnings release the company noted it was in exclusive negotiations with a potential acquirer. The share price was $2.97 prior to that announcement. On July 21, 2025, PharmChem announced an agreement to sell the company for $3.75 per share with an expected close in early September. Most of the shares held by the fund were from a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a basis of $2.85 per share. The fund received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024. Based on a $3.75 per share buyout price, total gross return over two years will be approximately 40%. Update on Other Fund Holdings ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the second quarter from $12.00 per share to $15.65 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of June 2025, AUM was in excess of $4.0 billion, an increase of over 16% in the first half alone. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds. ENDI’s operating margins in each of the last three quarters were 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 46 to 48%. First quarter cash earnings were $0.39 per share, or $1.56 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2025 were approximately $3.00 per share, meaning the stock was trading at roughly eight times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per share versus the current $16 share price. Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. Investment in CBE LLC (private) CBE LLC is the entity that purchased 25% of CrossingBridge Advisors. Let’s first understand why ENDI sold 25% of CrossingBridge. There were two reasons as we saw it. First, what it allowed them to do. CrossingBridge sub-advises the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund. The fund has approximately $750 million in assets. Due to the sub-advisory relationship there is a 50/50 split of revenue. If there is a change in control of CrossingBridge, defined as a sale of 25% or more, then CrossingBridge has the right to purchase RiverPark’s interest for three years worth of revenue payments. The buyout price is basically three times earnings since the additional revenue would have no operating cost associated with it. Second, the deal would show the true value of CrossingBridge, and ENDI in turn. By selling 25% of Crossing Bridge for $25.9 million, it implied a value for all of CrossingBridge of roughly $105 million. At the beginning of the year when the deal was being put together, ENDI’s market cap was around $65 million. The sale would show that the market was undervaluing ENDI. Those are the two main reasons why CrossingBridge wanted to sell 25% of itself. The next piece is at what price did 25% of CrossingBridge sell for. The deal was structured at 8.5 times EBITDA which is a bit on the high side for asset managers, although CrossingBridge runs higher operating margins than most managers, has a more impressive growth rate, as we noted above, and we think is run by a great CEO. Further, the deal was structured so that the $25.9 million for the 25% stake was staying inside CrossingBridge. Thus the valuation, net of cash in CrossingBridge was closer to six and a half times EBITDA, net of cash. Just as we thought ENDI was attractive at its growth rate, we thought the same was true for CrossingBridge. What is interesting for the investor in CBE is how the deal was structured. It is structured such that CBE earns a revenue royalty on all CrossingBridge revenue. When the deal was being put together CrossingBridge had a revenue run rate of roughly $17.5 million. RiverPark was earning $2.5 million on its 50% share of RiverPark Short Term High Yield fund. Doing the deal would increase CrossingBridge’s revenue by $2.5 million or roughly 14.5%. The deal was structured so that CBE investors earn roughly that percentage of CrossingBridge revenue as a royalty, which works out to an approximately 11% yield. We found the investment attractive due to the high yield and the fact that investors in CBE also participate in any growth in the coming years via the royalty increasing as revenue increases and having the ability to convert into straight equity if there was any eventual sale of the business. The fund has three percent of its assts in CBE. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2025 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices made a strong recovery in the second quarter. The ones that suffered the
most in the first quarter increased the most in the second quarter. The NASDAQ rose 17.7%
in Q2 after declining 10.4% in Q1, while the S&P500 rose 10.8% in Q2 after falling 4.3% in
Q1. Cedar Creek was up 5.8% in the second quarter, compared to a gain of 8.7% in the first
quarter, net of fees and expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 15.1%.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ½ year history is 14.45%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,281.0%, net of fees and expenses.
Q2 ‘25 Q1 ‘25 ‘25YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 5.8% 8.7% 15.1% 1,281.0% 14.4%
NASDAQ 17.7% -10.4% 5.5% 779.1% 11.8%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.8% -4.3% 6.1% 592.0% 10.4%
DJIA (DIA) 5.4% -1.0% 4.4% 524.0% 9.9%
Russell 2000 8.5% -9.5% -1.8% 300.1% 7.4%
Russell Microcap 15.5% -14.4% -1.1% 214.4% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,380,992
as of June 30, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we
compare against would have only grown to between $314,382 in the Russell MicroCap and
$879,127 in the NASDAQ.
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.4
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.8 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.7 times.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend yield was 2.5%. Weighted expected return on
equity as of June 30, 2025, was 18.9%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3% largely due to
the investment in CBE LLC, which we will discuss later.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 35% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending
on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders
(unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website,
sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just
shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each
roughly 3% of the fund.
As we noted last quarter, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares (MCBS) for
cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary shareholder and regulatory
approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter,
a slight improvement from prior announcements which had said during the fourth quarter.
There is still a large gap between expected proceeds and recent trades in First IC. Illiquidity
seems to be the cause, not uncertainty on whether the deal will close.
Subsequent to quarter end we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert:
PHIG). As of today, it is nearly a 7% position. We think it is worth two to three times the
most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services for the
global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry. The
Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was
primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently
focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company
had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year.
Performance Attribution
Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert
market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have
greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities.
Most of the fund’s performance in the second quarter was due to the increase in the valuation
of our control positions. They increased 14% in aggregate in the quarter. Our expert market
basket of stocks increased in value by just over 1% in the second quarter, while our generally
undervalued securities increased 8%.

Update on Propel Media
Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are
completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there
are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be
acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15
per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and
IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked,
we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in
published reports. The fund’s valuation increased from $0.85 per share to $0.90 per share
in the quarter.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous
10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait.
Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In April of this year
we received a dividend of just over $0.01 per
share, much earlier than the normal 90 day
interval. In total we have received over $0.086
per share in dividends, or 35% of our purchase
price in two years (see chart).3 It has now been
almost 100 days since the last dividend. Since
Propel is a black box we do not know why the
delay, but are not overly concerned about it.
Last quarter we included another interesting data
point we track - Propel’s level of borrowing and
its loan capacity. Propel’s main business,
DeepIntent, has an asset-based loan (ABL)
facility with a publicly reporting company, SLR
Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each quarter and also their
unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed by DeepIntent but
also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our understanding that most
lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s accounts receivable. It seems
reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment terms on its accounts
receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run rate. It would be the
current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to 90% to give us total
receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of receivables to 365
days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown in four columns of
chart below).
DeepIntent borrowings from SLR Investment estimated annual revenue run rate

03/31/24 23,115 6,885 30,000 123,280 130,532 154,100 163,165
3 We believe the dividends are due to net income since they are reported as dividends and not return of capital.

Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error.
What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end
of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150
million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue
run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80%
from a year earlier. In the first quarter, revenue run rate appears to be between $230 and
$304 million, an increase of 14% in the first quarter alone (last line of the chart). To say we
are eagerly waiting to read SLR’s second quarter filing is an understatement.
Update on Our Control Positions
As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a
position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what
he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way
it should be at all companies.
Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $14.28 per share to
$15.75 per share during the second quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a
board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the
fund manager owns 2.5% personally.
While reported earnings have been soft the last few quarters due to lower revenues owing to
timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing a material uptick in orders at the end of
fiscal 2025. In the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings were $8.0 million
in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two-year order for
HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s
second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025,
Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of $3.1
million. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest
defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-
Air Missile) components. The order is believed to include parts for two or three years of SM-
6 missile production as well, which is reportedly used, or intended to be used, to shoot down
hypersonic missiles.
In the first quarter ending May 31, 2025, bookings were $2.8 million versus sales of $2.7
million. We expect revenue to begin to reflect the higher backlog in the second quarter and
fully reflect it in the third quarter. There continues to be strong domestic and foreign demand
for both HIMARS and AMRAAM. The military has submitted an unfunded priorities list for a
doubling in AMRAAM production by 2028 but any increase is up to Congress.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares,
and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.20 per
share to $3.75 in the second quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to
detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. On February 3, 2025 the
Company announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release noted that
PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the
Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. In its May 9, 2025, earnings release
the company noted it was in exclusive negotiations with a potential acquirer. The share price
was $2.97 prior to that announcement. On July 21, 2025, PharmChem announced an

agreement to sell the company for $3.75 per share with an expected close in early
September.
Most of the shares held by the fund were from a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a
basis of $2.85 per share. The fund received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024.
Based on a $3.75 per share buyout price, total gross return over two years will be
approximately 40%.
Update on Other Fund Holdings
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share
price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the second quarter from
$12.00 per share to $15.65 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages
fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM)
for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024,
adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at
the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of June 2025, AUM was in excess
of $4.0 billion, an increase of over 16% in the first half alone. We think the current interest
rate environment is attractive for short term bonds.
ENDI’s operating margins in each of the last three quarters were 32% but that is misleading.
ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and
other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 46 to 48%. First
quarter cash earnings were $0.39 per share, or $1.56 per share annualized.4 Net cash and
investments at the end of the first quarter of 2025 were approximately $3.00 per share,
meaning the stock was trading at roughly eight times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in
our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times
cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run
rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per
share versus the current $16 share price.5
Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in
exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other
entities affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction.
We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional
capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management.
Investment in CBE LLC (private)
CBE LLC is the entity that purchased 25% of CrossingBridge Advisors. Let’s first understand
why ENDI sold 25% of CrossingBridge. There were two reasons as we saw it. First, what it
allowed them to do. CrossingBridge sub-advises the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund.
4 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.
5 A slight discount might be needed to account for outstanding warrants. Analysis excludes impact of partial sale of
CrossingBridge, which will significantly increase cash.

The fund has approximately $750 million in assets. Due to the sub-advisory relationship
there is a 50/50 split of revenue. If there is a change in control of CrossingBridge, defined
as a sale of 25% or more, then CrossingBridge has the right to purchase RiverPark’s interest
for three years worth of revenue payments. The buyout price is basically three times earnings
since the additional revenue would have no operating cost associated with it.
Second, the deal would show the true value of CrossingBridge, and ENDI in turn. By selling
25% of Crossing Bridge for $25.9 million, it implied a value for all of CrossingBridge of roughly
$105 million. At the beginning of the year when the deal was being put together, ENDI’s
market cap was around $65 million. The sale would show that the market was undervaluing
ENDI. Those are the two main reasons why CrossingBridge wanted to sell 25% of itself.
The next piece is at what price did 25% of CrossingBridge sell for. The deal was structured
at 8.5 times EBITDA which is a bit on the high side for asset managers, although
CrossingBridge runs higher operating margins than most managers, has a more impressive
growth rate, as we noted above, and we think is run by a great CEO. Further, the deal was
structured so that the $25.9 million for the 25% stake was staying inside CrossingBridge.
Thus the valuation, net of cash in CrossingBridge was closer to six and a half times EBITDA,
net of cash. Just as we thought ENDI was attractive at its growth rate, we thought the same
was true for CrossingBridge.
What is interesting for the investor in CBE is how the deal was structured. It is structured
such that CBE earns a revenue royalty on all CrossingBridge revenue. When the deal was
being put together CrossingBridge had a revenue run rate of roughly $17.5 million. RiverPark
was earning $2.5 million on its 50% share of RiverPark Short Term High Yield fund. Doing
the deal would increase CrossingBridge’s revenue by $2.5 million or roughly 14.5%. The deal
was structured so that CBE investors earn roughly that percentage of CrossingBridge revenue
as a royalty, which works out to an approximately 11% yield.
We found the investment attractive due to the high yield and the fact that investors in CBE
also participate in any growth in the coming years via the royalty increasing as revenue
increases and having the ability to convert into straight equity if there was any eventual sale
of the business. The fund has three percent of its assts in CBE.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The ones that suffered the most in the first quarter increased the most in the second quarter. The NASDAQ rose 17.7% in Q2 after declining 10.4% in Q1, while the S&P500 rose 10.8% in Q2 after falling 4.3% in Q1. Cedar Creek was up 5.8% in the second quarter, compared to a gain of 8.7% in the first quarter, net of fees and expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 15.1%. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ½ year history is 14.45%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,281.0%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘25 Q1 ‘25 ‘25YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 5.8% 8.7% 15.1% 1,281.0% 14.4% NASDAQ 17.7% -10.4% 5.5% 779.1% 11.8% S&P 500 (SPY) 10.8% -4.3% 6.1% 592.0% 10.4% DJIA (DIA) 5.4% -1.0% 4.4% 524.0% 9.9% Russell 2000 8.5% -9.5% -1.8% 300.1% 7.4% Russell Microcap 15.5% -14.4% -1.1% 214.4% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,380,992 as of June 30, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $314,382 in the Russell MicroCap and $879,127 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.4 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.8 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.7 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend yield was 2.5%. Weighted expected return on equity as of June 30, 2025, was 18.9%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3% largely due to the investment in CBE LLC, which we will discuss later. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 35% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders (unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly. Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund. As we noted last quarter, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares (MCBS) for cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from prior announcements which had said during the fourth quarter. There is still a large gap between expected proceeds and recent trades in First IC. Illiquidity seems to be the cause, not uncertainty on whether the deal will close. Subsequent to quarter end we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert: PHIG). As of today, it is nearly a 7% position. We think it is worth two to three times the most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services for the global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry. The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year. Performance Attribution Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities. Most of the fund’s performance in the second quarter was due to the increase in the valuation of our control positions. They increased 14% in aggregate in the quarter. Our expert market basket of stocks increased in value by just over 1% in the second quarter, while our generally undervalued securities increased 8%. Update on Propel Media Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15 per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked, we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. The fund’s valuation increased from $0.85 per share to $0.90 per share in the quarter. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous 10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In April of this year we received a dividend of just over $0.01 per share, much earlier than the normal 90 day interval. In total we have received over $0.086 per share in dividends, or 35% of our purchase price in two years (see chart). It has now been almost 100 days since the last dividend. Since Propel is a black box we do not know why the delay, but are not overly concerned about it. Last quarter we included another interesting data point we track - Propel’s level of borrowing and its loan capacity. Propel’s main business, DeepIntent, has an asset-based loan (ABL) facility with a publicly reporting company, SLR Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each quarter and also their unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed by DeepIntent but also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our understanding that most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s accounts receivable. It seems reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment terms on its accounts receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run rate. It would be the current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to 90% to give us total receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of receivables to 365 days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown in four columns of chart below). DeepIntent borrowings from SLR Investment estimated annual revenue run rate 75 days 75 days 60 days 60 days Date Borrowed Unfunded Total 90% 85% 90% 85% 12/31/22 16,951 3,049 20,000 90,405 95,723 113,007 119,654 03/31/23 16,883 3,117 20,000 90,043 95,339 112,553 119,174 06/30/23 18,075 1,925 20,000 96,400 102,071 120,500 127,588 09/30/23 - - - - - - - 12/31/23 21,067 3,933 25,000 112,357 118,967 140,447 148,708 03/31/24 23,115 6,885 30,000 123,280 130,532 154,100 163,165 06/30/24 25,172 4,828 30,000 134,251 142,148 167,813 177,685 09/30/24 26,527 3,473 30,000 141,477 149,800 176,847 187,249 12/31/24 37,746 7,254 45,000 201,312 213,154 251,640 266,442 03/31/25 43,102 1,898 45,000 229,877 243,400 287,347 304,249 Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error. What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150 million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80% from a year earlier. In the first quarter, revenue run rate appears to be between $230 and $304 million, an increase of 14% in the first quarter alone (last line of the chart). To say we are eagerly waiting to read SLR’s second quarter filing is an understatement. Update on Our Control Positions As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $14.28 per share to $15.75 per share during the second quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the fund manager owns 2.5% personally. While reported earnings have been soft the last few quarters due to lower revenues owing to timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing a material uptick in orders at the end of fiscal 2025. In the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two-year order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of $3.1 million. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. The order is believed to include parts for two or three years of SM-6 missile production as well, which is reportedly used, or intended to be used, to shoot down hypersonic missiles. In the first quarter ending May 31, 2025, bookings were $2.8 million versus sales of $2.7 million. We expect revenue to begin to reflect the higher backlog in the second quarter and fully reflect it in the third quarter. There continues to be strong domestic and foreign demand for both HIMARS and AMRAAM. The military has submitted an unfunded priorities list for a doubling in AMRAAM production by 2028 but any increase is up to Congress. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.20 per share to $3.75 in the second quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. On February 3, 2025 the Company announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release noted that PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. In its May 9, 2025, earnings release the company noted it was in exclusive negotiations with a potential acquirer. The share price was $2.97 prior to that announcement. On July 21, 2025, PharmChem announced an agreement to sell the company for $3.75 per share with an expected close in early September. Most of the shares held by the fund were from a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a basis of $2.85 per share. The fund received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024. Based on a $3.75 per share buyout price, total gross return over two years will be approximately 40%. Update on Other Fund Holdings ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the second quarter from $12.00 per share to $15.65 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of June 2025, AUM was in excess of $4.0 billion, an increase of over 16% in the first half alone. We think the current interest rate environment is attractive for short term bonds. ENDI’s operating margins in each of the last three quarters were 32% but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 46 to 48%. First quarter cash earnings were $0.39 per share, or $1.56 per share annualized. Net cash and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2025 were approximately $3.00 per share, meaning the stock was trading at roughly eight times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per share versus the current $16 share price. Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. Investment in CBE LLC (private) CBE LLC is the entity that purchased 25% of CrossingBridge Advisors. Let’s first understand why ENDI sold 25% of CrossingBridge. There were two reasons as we saw it. First, what it allowed them to do. CrossingBridge sub-advises the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund. The fund has approximately $750 million in assets. Due to the sub-advisory relationship there is a 50/50 split of revenue. If there is a change in control of CrossingBridge, defined as a sale of 25% or more, then CrossingBridge has the right to purchase RiverPark’s interest for three years worth of revenue payments. The buyout price is basically three times earnings since the additional revenue would have no operating cost associated with it. Second, the deal would show the true value of CrossingBridge, and ENDI in turn. By selling 25% of Crossing Bridge for $25.9 million, it implied a value for all of CrossingBridge of roughly $105 million. At the beginning of the year when the deal was being put together, ENDI’s market cap was around $65 million. The sale would show that the market was undervaluing ENDI. Those are the two main reasons why CrossingBridge wanted to sell 25% of itself. The next piece is at what price did 25% of CrossingBridge sell for. The deal was structured at 8.5 times EBITDA which is a bit on the high side for asset managers, although CrossingBridge runs higher operating margins than most managers, has a more impressive growth rate, as we noted above, and we think is run by a great CEO. Further, the deal was structured so that the $25.9 million for the 25% stake was staying inside CrossingBridge. Thus the valuation, net of cash in CrossingBridge was closer to six and a half times EBITDA, net of cash. Just as we thought ENDI was attractive at its growth rate, we thought the same was true for CrossingBridge. What is interesting for the investor in CBE is how the deal was structured. It is structured such that CBE earns a revenue royalty on all CrossingBridge revenue. When the deal was being put together CrossingBridge had a revenue run rate of roughly $17.5 million. RiverPark was earning $2.5 million on its 50% share of RiverPark Short Term High Yield fund. Doing the deal would increase CrossingBridge’s revenue by $2.5 million or roughly 14.5%. The deal was structured so that CBE investors earn roughly that percentage of CrossingBridge revenue as a royalty, which works out to an approximately 11% yield. We found the investment attractive due to the high yield and the fact that investors in CBE also participate in any growth in the coming years via the royalty increasing as revenue increases and having the ability to convert into straight equity if there was any eventual sale of the business. The fund has three percent of its assts in CBE. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2025 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices made a strong recovery in the second quarter. The ones that suffered the
most in the first quarter increased the most in the second quarter. The NASDAQ rose 17.7%
in Q2 after declining 10.4% in Q1, while the S&P500 rose 10.8% in Q2 after falling 4.3% in
Q1. Cedar Creek was up 5.8% in the second quarter, compared to a gain of 8.7% in the first
quarter, net of fees and expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 15.1%.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ½ year history is 14.45%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,281.0%, net of fees and expenses.
Q2 ‘25 Q1 ‘25 ‘25YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 5.8% 8.7% 15.1% 1,281.0% 14.4%
NASDAQ 17.7% -10.4% 5.5% 779.1% 11.8%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.8% -4.3% 6.1% 592.0% 10.4%
DJIA (DIA) 5.4% -1.0% 4.4% 524.0% 9.9%

* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,380,992
as of June 30, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we
compare against would have only grown to between $314,382 in the Russell MicroCap and
$879,127 in the NASDAQ.
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8.4
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.8 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.7 times.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend yield was 2.5%. Weighted expected return on
equity as of June 30, 2025, was 18.9%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3% largely due to
the investment in CBE LLC, which we will discuss later.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market held steady at 35% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending
on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders
(unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website,
sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just
shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly.
Four positions make up about 80% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 12% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 9%, PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each
roughly 3% of the fund.
As we noted last quarter, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares (MCBS) for
cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary shareholder and regulatory
approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter,
a slight improvement from prior announcements which had said during the fourth quarter.
There is still a large gap between expected proceeds and recent trades in First IC. Illiquidity
seems to be the cause, not uncertainty on whether the deal will close.
Subsequent to quarter end we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert:
PHIG). As of today, it is nearly a 7% position. We think it is worth two to three times the
most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services for the
global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry. The
Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was
primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently
focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company
had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year.
Performance Attribution
Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert
market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have
greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities.
Most of the fund’s performance in the second quarter was due to the increase in the valuation
of our control positions. They increased 14% in aggregate in the quarter. Our expert market
basket of stocks increased in value by just over 1% in the second quarter, while our generally
undervalued securities increased 8%.

Update on Propel Media
Propel Media (expert: PROM) – has not publicly reported financials since 2019. We are
completely left on our own to figure out revenue and profitability. We do know that there
are 252 million shares outstanding. We also know that in 2022 they had agreed to be
acquired by IQVIA Holdings (nyse: IQV) for between $700 and $800 million ($2.75 to $3.15
per share); however, in early 2024 the deal was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and
IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. In June 2023, prior to the deal being blocked,
we were able to purchase shares for $0.24 per share after becoming aware of the deal in
published reports. The fund’s valuation increased from $0.85 per share to $0.90 per share
in the quarter.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. If it did, we expected a ridiculous
10-12x return. If it didn’t, we believed we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait.
Unexpectedly, Propel began paying a quarterly dividend in August 2023. In April of this year
we received a dividend of just over $0.01 per
share, much earlier than the normal 90 day
interval. In total we have received over $0.086
per share in dividends, or 35% of our purchase
price in two years (see chart).3 It has now been
almost 100 days since the last dividend. Since
Propel is a black box we do not know why the
delay, but are not overly concerned about it.
Last quarter we included another interesting data
point we track - Propel’s level of borrowing and
its loan capacity. Propel’s main business,
DeepIntent, has an asset-based loan (ABL)
facility with a publicly reporting company, SLR
Investment Corp (Nasdaq: SLRC). SLR lists all their loans each quarter and also their
unfunded commitments. This allows us to track the level of debt owed by DeepIntent but
also gives us a good idea of their current revenue run rate. It is our understanding that most
lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85 to 90% of a company’s accounts receivable. It seems
reasonable to assume DeepIntent grants 60 to 75 day payment terms on its accounts
receivables. Based on this we can estimate DeepIntent’s revenue run rate. It would be the
current ABL loan amount (borrowed column below) divided by 85 to 90% to give us total
receivables, and then multiplied by six (to annualize the sixty days of receivables to 365
days) to give us approximate annualized revenue run rate (ranges shown in four columns of
chart below).
DeepIntent borrowings from SLR Investment estimated annual revenue run rate
75 days 75 days 60 days 60 days
Date Borrowed Unfunded Total 90% 85% 90% 85%
12/31/22 16,951 3,049 20,000 90,405 95,723 113,007 119,654

03/31/24 23,115 6,885 30,000 123,280 130,532 154,100 163,165
3 We believe the dividends are due to net income since they are reported as dividends and not return of capital.

Numbers in 000’s. DeepIntent either paid off the loan at 09/23 or there was a reporting error.
What we learn is that annualized revenue was likely between $90 and $120 million at the end
of 2022 (first line of chart). That revenue appears to have risen to between $112 and $150
million as of the end of 2023, an increase of nearly 25%. By the end of 2024 the revenue
run rate appears to have been between $200 and $266 million, or an increase of nearly 80%
from a year earlier. In the first quarter, revenue run rate appears to be between $230 and
$304 million, an increase of 14% in the first quarter alone (last line of the chart). To say we
are eagerly waiting to read SLR’s second quarter filing is an understatement.
Update on Our Control Positions
As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a
position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what
he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have strong independent boards, which is the way
it should be at all companies.
Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $14.28 per share to
$15.75 per share during the second quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a
board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the
fund manager owns 2.5% personally.
While reported earnings have been soft the last few quarters due to lower revenues owing to
timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing a material uptick in orders at the end of
fiscal 2025. In the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings were $8.0 million
in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. Bookings included a large two-year order for
HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s
second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025,
Solitron did even better. Bookings in the quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of $3.1
million. Bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest
defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-
Air Missile) components. The order is believed to include parts for two or three years of SM-
6 missile production as well, which is reportedly used, or intended to be used, to shoot down
hypersonic missiles.
In the first quarter ending May 31, 2025, bookings were $2.8 million versus sales of $2.7
million. We expect revenue to begin to reflect the higher backlog in the second quarter and
fully reflect it in the third quarter. There continues to be strong domestic and foreign demand
for both HIMARS and AMRAAM. The military has submitted an unfunded priorities list for a
doubling in AMRAAM production by 2028 but any increase is up to Congress.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares,
and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares increased from $3.20 per
share to $3.75 in the second quarter of 2025. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to
detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. On February 3, 2025 the
Company announced the exploration of strategic alternatives (link). The release noted that
PharmChem will consider various options, including acquisitions, potential sale of the
Company, merger or a debt financed special dividend. In its May 9, 2025, earnings release
the company noted it was in exclusive negotiations with a potential acquirer. The share price
was $2.97 prior to that announcement. On July 21, 2025, PharmChem announced an

agreement to sell the company for $3.75 per share with an expected close in early
September.
Most of the shares held by the fund were from a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a
basis of $2.85 per share. The fund received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024.
Based on a $3.75 per share buyout price, total gross return over two years will be
approximately 40%.
Update on Other Fund Holdings
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share
price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the second quarter from
$12.00 per share to $15.65 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages
fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM)
for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024,
adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at
the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of June 2025, AUM was in excess
of $4.0 billion, an increase of over 16% in the first half alone. We think the current interest
rate environment is attractive for short term bonds.
ENDI’s operating margins in each of the last three quarters were 32% but that is misleading.
ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and
other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 46 to 48%. First
quarter cash earnings were $0.39 per share, or $1.56 per share annualized.4 Net cash and
investments at the end of the first quarter of 2025 were approximately $3.00 per share,
meaning the stock was trading at roughly eight times earnings, net of cash, at quarter end.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute. We wrote in
our 2024 yearend letter that, based on their recent growth, a valuation of 12 to 15 times
cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run
rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per
share versus the current $16 share price.5
Subsequent to quarter end, ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in
exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other
entities affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction.
We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge and provides additional
capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management.
Investment in CBE LLC (private)
CBE LLC is the entity that purchased 25% of CrossingBridge Advisors. Let’s first understand
why ENDI sold 25% of CrossingBridge. There were two reasons as we saw it. First, what it
allowed them to do. CrossingBridge sub-advises the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund.
4 Accounting Note: We ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. While we
understand the intent, it is one of our least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during
the quarter the company is hit with a non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued
warrants is now higher. Conversely, if the stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit
to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants remains unchanged under both scenarios. The end
result is the better the business does the worse reported results are and vice versa. That makes no
sense to us. We prefer the impact be captured in diluted earnings per share.
5 A slight discount might be needed to account for outstanding warrants. Analysis excludes impact of partial sale of
CrossingBridge, which will significantly increase cash.

The fund has approximately $750 million in assets. Due to the sub-advisory relationship
there is a 50/50 split of revenue. If there is a change in control of CrossingBridge, defined
as a sale of 25% or more, then CrossingBridge has the right to purchase RiverPark’s interest
for three years worth of revenue payments. The buyout price is basically three times earnings
since the additional revenue would have no operating cost associated with it.
Second, the deal would show the true value of CrossingBridge, and ENDI in turn. By selling
25% of Crossing Bridge for $25.9 million, it implied a value for all of CrossingBridge of roughly
$105 million. At the beginning of the year when the deal was being put together, ENDI’s
market cap was around $65 million. The sale would show that the market was undervaluing
ENDI. Those are the two main reasons why CrossingBridge wanted to sell 25% of itself.
The next piece is at what price did 25% of CrossingBridge sell for. The deal was structured
at 8.5 times EBITDA which is a bit on the high side for asset managers, although
CrossingBridge runs higher operating margins than most managers, has a more impressive
growth rate, as we noted above, and we think is run by a great CEO. Further, the deal was
structured so that the $25.9 million for the 25% stake was staying inside CrossingBridge.
Thus the valuation, net of cash in CrossingBridge was closer to six and a half times EBITDA,
net of cash. Just as we thought ENDI was attractive at its growth rate, we thought the same
was true for CrossingBridge.
What is interesting for the investor in CBE is how the deal was structured. It is structured
such that CBE earns a revenue royalty on all CrossingBridge revenue. When the deal was
being put together CrossingBridge had a revenue run rate of roughly $17.5 million. RiverPark
was earning $2.5 million on its 50% share of RiverPark Short Term High Yield fund. Doing
the deal would increase CrossingBridge’s revenue by $2.5 million or roughly 14.5%. The deal
was structured so that CBE investors earn roughly that percentage of CrossingBridge revenue
as a royalty, which works out to an approximately 11% yield.
We found the investment attractive due to the high yield and the fact that investors in CBE
also participate in any growth in the coming years via the royalty increasing as revenue
increases and having the ability to convert into straight equity if there was any eventual sale
of the business. The fund has three percent of its assts in CBE.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices

The market continued to be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2% and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up 5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the first quarter, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses. Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4% NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3% S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9% DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8% Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7% Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175 as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap and $707,239 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times. The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only $8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker. Expert Market Exposure Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund. Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at 28% of the fund. An Attractive Asset Manager Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off. An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment, Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to a handful of funds. In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge, Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business. The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In 2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024. On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five. On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024. According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and they are yet to target large family offices. On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should reduce professional fees. On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million. ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a $36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently $2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share. What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7 million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer. We estimate March 2024 cash and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six times earnings net of cash. We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35 to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful. We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of 2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the quarter. PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a $0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share. PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share. The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor can figure out how the rest of the year should look. Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait. During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation. In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05 trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and $0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices for the net profits interest. As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to the trust at its creation, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it. Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9 million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60 per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023. We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses, additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less than what is reported on the bank’s call report. Tax Information and K-1’s Investor K-1’s were issued electronically on April 4. The fund’s annual audit report was sent electronically on April 27 and again on May 4 due to email issues. If any of the fund’s investors did not receive either, please contact us. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all experienced a strong start to 2024. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2%
and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up
5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the
first quarter, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8%
Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7%
Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175
as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap
and $707,239 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times.
The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a
poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend
yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our
holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other
smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we
estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only
$8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker.
Expert Market Exposure
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at
28% of the fund.
An Attractive Asset Manager
Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI
Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed
to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to
that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company
was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The
company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off.
An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment,
Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab
and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial
investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered
Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the
investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet
dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares
from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to
a handful of funds.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick
Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual
funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge,
Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The
deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management
albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer
ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its
advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity
with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business.
The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In
2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per
share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a
number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024.
On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income
Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own
the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue
for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five.
On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High
Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended
for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under
management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024.
According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and
they are yet to target large family offices.
On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should
reduce professional fees.
On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short
Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick
for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million.
ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a
$36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was
that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased
earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently
$2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to
the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but
we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share.
What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7
million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million
of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build
faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer.3 We estimate March 2024 cash
3 Accounting Note: I ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. It is one of my
least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a
non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely if the
stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants
remains unchanged under both scenarios.

and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six
times earnings net of cash.
We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35
to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the
end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher
earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to
ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful.
We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of
2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its
acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily
for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with
operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the
acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the
quarter.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the
end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat
patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last
few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing
sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In
the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the
year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based
on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our
CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson
Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able
to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a
$0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share.
PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-
time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share.
The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a
lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor
can figure out how the rest of the year should look.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).

During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per
share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people
into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based
on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation.
In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks
at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if
in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this
case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05
trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or
contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after
the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and
$0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly
dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend
yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus
the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than
the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior
three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The
current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the
special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed
the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from
replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval
to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed
since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a
worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices
for the net profits interest.
As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset
retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate
of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units
outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld
funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly
more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to
the trust at its creation4, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust
would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until
incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production
4 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019.

has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges
the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was
sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple
of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9
million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60
per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings,
but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings
for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the
reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter
call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of
2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million
shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased
by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023.
We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding
company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus
generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses,
additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding
company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less
than what is reported on the bank’s call report.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The market continued to be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2% and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up 5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the first quarter, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses. Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4% NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3% S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9% DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8% Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7% Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175 as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap and $707,239 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times. The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only $8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker. Expert Market Exposure Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund. Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at 28% of the fund. An Attractive Asset Manager Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off. An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment, Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to a handful of funds. In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge, Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business. The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In 2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024. On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five. On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024. According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and they are yet to target large family offices. On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should reduce professional fees. On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million. ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a $36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently $2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share. What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7 million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer. We estimate March 2024 cash and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six times earnings net of cash. We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35 to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful. We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of 2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the quarter. PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a $0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share. PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share. The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor can figure out how the rest of the year should look. Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait. During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation. In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05 trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and $0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices for the net profits interest. As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to the trust at its creation, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it. Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9 million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60 per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023. We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses, additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less than what is reported on the bank’s call report.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all experienced a strong start to 2024. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2%
and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up
5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the
first quarter, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8%
Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7%
Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175
as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap
and $707,239 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times.
The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a
poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend
yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our
holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other
smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we
estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only
$8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker.
Expert Market Exposure
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at
28% of the fund.
An Attractive Asset Manager
Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI
Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed
to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to
that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company
was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The
company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off.
An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment,
Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab
and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial
investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered
Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the
investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet
dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares
from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to
a handful of funds.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick
Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual
funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge,
Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The
deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management
albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer
ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its
advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity
with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business.
The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In
2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per
share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a
number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024.
On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income
Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own
the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue
for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five.
On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High
Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended
for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under
management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024.
According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and
they are yet to target large family offices.
On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should
reduce professional fees.
On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short
Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick
for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million.
ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a
$36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was
that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased
earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently
$2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to
the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but
we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share.
What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7
million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million
of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build
faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer.3 We estimate March 2024 cash
3 Accounting Note: I ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. It is one of my
least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a
non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely if the
stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants
remains unchanged under both scenarios.

and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six
times earnings net of cash.
We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35
to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the
end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher
earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to
ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful.
We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of
2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its
acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily
for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with
operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the
acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the
quarter.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the
end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat
patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last
few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing
sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In
the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the
year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based
on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our
CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson
Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able
to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a
$0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share.
PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-
time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share.
The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a
lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor
can figure out how the rest of the year should look.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).

During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per
share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people
into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based
on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation.
In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks
at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if
in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this
case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05
trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or
contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after
the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and
$0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly
dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend
yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus
the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than
the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior
three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The
current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the
special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed
the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from
replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval
to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed
since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a
worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices
for the net profits interest.
As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset
retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate
of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units
outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld
funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly
more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to
the trust at its creation4, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust
would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until
incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production
4 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019.

has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges
the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was
sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple
of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9
million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60
per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings,
but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings
for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the
reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter
call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of
2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million
shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased
by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023.
We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding
company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus
generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses,
additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding
company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less
than what is reported on the bank’s call report.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all experienced a strong start to 2024. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2%
and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up
5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the
first quarter, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8%
Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7%
Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175
as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap
and $707,239 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times.
The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a
poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend
yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our
holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other
smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we
estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only
$8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker.
Expert Market Exposure
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at
28% of the fund.
An Attractive Asset Manager
Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI
Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed
to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to
that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company
was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The
company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off.
An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment,
Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab
and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial
investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered
Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the
investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet
dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares
from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to
a handful of funds.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick
Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual
funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge,
Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The
deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management
albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer
ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its
advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity
with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business.
The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In
2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per
share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a
number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024.
On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income
Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own
the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue
for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five.
On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High
Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended
for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under
management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024.
According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and
they are yet to target large family offices.
On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should
reduce professional fees.
On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short
Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick
for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million.
ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a
$36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was
that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased
earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently
$2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to
the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but
we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share.
What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7
million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million
of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build
faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer.3 We estimate March 2024 cash
3 Accounting Note: I ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. It is one of my
least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a
non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely if the
stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants
remains unchanged under both scenarios.

and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six
times earnings net of cash.
We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35
to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the
end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher
earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to
ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful.
We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of
2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its
acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily
for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with
operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the
acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the
quarter.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the
end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat
patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last
few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing
sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In
the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the
year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based
on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our
CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson
Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able
to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a
$0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share.
PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-
time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share.
The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a
lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor
can figure out how the rest of the year should look.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).

During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per
share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people
into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based
on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation.
In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks
at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if
in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this
case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05
trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or
contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after
the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and
$0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly
dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend
yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus
the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than
the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior
three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The
current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the
special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed
the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from
replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval
to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed
since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a
worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices
for the net profits interest.
As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset
retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate
of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units
outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld
funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly
more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to
the trust at its creation4, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust
would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until
incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production
4 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019.

has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges
the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was
sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple
of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9
million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60
per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings,
but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings
for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the
reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter
call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of
2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million
shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased
by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023.
We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding
company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus
generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses,
additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding
company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less
than what is reported on the bank’s call report.
Tax Information and K-1’s
Investor K-1’s were issued electronically on April 4. The fund’s annual audit report was sent
electronically on April 27 and again on May 4 due to email issues. If any of the fund’s
investors did not receive either, please contact us.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.
If this letter was passed on to you and you would like to be added to our monthly distribution
list, please email me at the email address below. You can find more letters at

least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a
non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely if the
stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants
remains unchanged under both scenarios.

and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six
times earnings net of cash.
We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35
to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the
end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher
earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to
ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful.
We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of
2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its
acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily
for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with
operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the
acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the
quarter.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the
end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat
patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last
few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing
sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In
the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the
year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based
on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our
CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson
Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able
to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a
$0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share.
PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-
time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share.
The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a
lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor
can figure out how the rest of the year should look.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).

During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per
share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people
into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based
on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation.
In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks
at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if
in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this
case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05
trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or
contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after
the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and
$0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly
dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend
yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus
the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than
the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior
three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The
current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the
special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed
the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from
replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval
to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed
since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a
worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices
for the net profits interest.
As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset
retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate
of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units
outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld
funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly
more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to
the trust at its creation4, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust
would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until
incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production
4 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019.

has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges
the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was
sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple
of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9
million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60
per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings,
but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings
for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the
reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter
call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of
2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million
shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased
by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023.
We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding
company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus
generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses,
additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding
company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less
than what is reported on the bank’s call report.
Tax Information and K-1’s
Investor K-1’s were issued electronically on April 4. The fund’s annual audit report was sent
electronically on April 27 and again on May 4 due to email issues. If any of the fund’s
investors did not receive either, please contact us.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all experienced a strong start to 2024. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2%
and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up
5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the
first quarter, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8%
Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7%
Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175
as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap
and $707,239 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times.
The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a
poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend
yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our
holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other
smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we
estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only
$8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker.
Expert Market Exposure
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at
28% of the fund.
An Attractive Asset Manager
Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI
Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed
to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to
that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company
was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The
company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off.
An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment,
Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab
and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial
investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered
Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the
investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet
dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares
from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to
a handful of funds.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick
Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual
funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge,
Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The
deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management
albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer
ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its
advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity
with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business.
The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In
2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per
share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a
number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024.
On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income
Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own
the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue
for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five.
On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High
Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended
for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under
management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024.
According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and
they are yet to target large family offices.
On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should
reduce professional fees.
On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short
Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick
for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million.
ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a
$36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was
that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased
earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently
$2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to
the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but
we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share.
What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7
million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million
of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build
faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer.3 We estimate March 2024 cash
3 Accounting Note: I ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. It is one of my
least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a
non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely if the
stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants
remains unchanged under both scenarios.

and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six
times earnings net of cash.
We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35
to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the
end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher
earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to
ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful.
We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of
2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its
acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily
for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with
operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the
acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the
quarter.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the
end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat
patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last
few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing
sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In
the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the
year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based
on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our
CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson
Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able
to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a
$0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share.
PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-
time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share.
The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a
lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor
can figure out how the rest of the year should look.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).

During the first quarter the very illiquid stock had a trade of 220 shares at just $0.05 per
share occur. The fund was the buyer. We had a decision to make – do we let new people
into the fund based on a $0.05 valuation for Propel? Do we redeem exiting partners based
on that valuation? We did not think it was an appropriate valuation.
In general, the fund values otc stocks at their most recent bid price, and expert market stocks
at their most recent sale price. For either pricing, management has the right to override if
in its judgment the price is not reflective of the market. We never had in the past. In this
case, the bid on Propel jumped to over thirty cents per share within minutes of the $0.05
trade. But there were no trades. We did not think it fair to investors redeeming or
contributing to value Propel at $0.05 per share. The trades prior to the $0.05 trade, after
the deal was called off totaled over 80,000 shares and were at prices between $0.70 and
$0.75 per share. Since we did not know actual earnings, and only had three recent quarterly
dividends, we adopted a valuation model with the value being based on an expected dividend
yield of 6%. This resulted in a valuation as of the end of March of $0.69 per share versus
the yearend price of $0.89 per share. This valuation was in line with recent trades other than
the one $0.05 tiny trade. The May 2024 dividend was lower than the average of the prior
three, therefore, the valuation model currently has the value at $0.59 per share in May. The
current bid is $0.32 per share and the ask is $1.00 per share.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.415 to $0.36 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The group we are part of that called the
special meeting was not able to find a qualified custodian willing to serve. This has allowed
the current custodian, BNY Mellon, to stay in place. The court prevented the operator from
replacing the custodian with a liquidation specialist. The custodian received court approval
to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Four months have passed
since then and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a
worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices
for the net profits interest.
As of the April 30, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $35.1 million for asset
retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate
of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $40.7 million. Total units
outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.91 per unit have been withheld and the withheld
funds amounted to $1.06 per unit after interest as of the end of February 2024. Significantly
more than the quarter end $0.36 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try an argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and (allegedly) transferred by the operator to
the trust at its creation4, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flows that the trust
would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until
incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production
4 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019.

has resulted in approximately $8.9 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges
the trust about $1.2 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the field was
sold, leaving trailing twelve-month cash flow of $7.7 million. The unknown is what multiple
of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of March was $13.9
million, or less than two years’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price rose from $37.70 per share at the end of 2023 to $49.60
per share at the end of the first quarter. Citizens typically does not report quarterly earnings,
but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings
for 2023 were $6.23 per share, but that included a large loss reserve for a loan. Absent the
reserve earnings would have been approximately $8 per share. Citizens filed its first quarter
call report and reported net income of $3.9 million versus $3.6 million for the first quarter of
2023. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million
shares to under 1.8 million shares, so earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 increased
by roughly 20% versus the first quarter of 2023.
We would note that call reports report earnings for the bank and not the bank holding
company. Citizens retains some investments at the holding company level and thus
generates additional income; however, the holding company also incurs overhead expenses,
additional taxes, and pays preferred dividends. In general, quarterly earnings for the holding
company, which is what shareholders actually own, are typically $150,000 to $175,000 less
than what is reported on the bank’s call report.

Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all experienced a strong start to 2024. The market continued to
be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to Q1 returns of 9.2%
and the S&P 500 of 10.4%. Smaller companies lagged once again. The Russell 2000 was up
5.2% and the Russell MicroCap index was up 4.7%. Cedar Creek increased by 2.4% in the
first quarter, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,067.2%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘24 2023 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.4% 20.3% 1,067.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 9.2% 43.4% 607.2% 11.3%
S&P 500 (SPY) 10.4% 26.2% 458.5% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) 6.0% 16.2% 450.1% 9.8%
Russell 2000 5.2% 16.9% 284.2% 7.7%
Russell Microcap 4.7% 9.3% 192.7% 6.1%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,167,175
as of March 31, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $292,668 in the Russell MicroCap
and $707,239 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.4 times.
The primary reason for the recent increase in multiples was due to one company having a
poor 2023 and our lowered expectation for 2024. Weighted price-to-book was 1.6. Dividend
yield was 1.7%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 20%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 7% and ended the quarter at 3%. We increased our
holdings in ENDI Corp (ENDI) and Saker Aviation (SKAS) along with a couple of other
smaller names. We discuss ENDI in detail below. Saker trades below net cash and we
estimate 2024 earnings of $1.70 per share. It is extremely small, with a market cap of only
$8.5 million. The fund filed a 13G in January noting that it owns more than 5% of Saker.
Expert Market Exposure
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 10% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 7% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 4% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all three of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 35% exposure to the expert market and ended at
28% of the fund.
An Attractive Asset Manager
Over the past nine months we have been able to build up a decent size position in ENDI
Corp (ENDI) at around $4 per share, or two times earnings net of cash. It has since climbed
to above $6.50 per share. ENDI Corp, formerly known as Enterprise Diversified and prior to
that Sitestar, has been quite a ride for long-term shareholders. Eight years ago, the company
was taken over by private investor Jeff Moore and Steven Kiel of Arquitos Capital. The
company invested into Alluvial Fund, managed by Dave Waters. Then the wheels came off.
An investment into an Arizona HVAC company failed miserably. The real estate investment,
Mt. Melrose, grew too quickly and spent capital buying more homes than they could rehab
and market in a reasonable amount of time, and was eventually sold. Then the Alluvial
investment, the only major part of the business performing well, grew too big and triggered
Investment Co. Act of 1940 regulatory issues. Management decided to fully redeem the
investment and by late 2021 ENDI was left with a pile of cash, a small yet profitable internet
dial up business, Sitestar, and Willow Oak Asset Management which had small revenue shares
from a few small hedge funds along with offering administrative and compliance services to
a handful of funds.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

In late December 2021 they announced a merger with CrossingBridge Advisors and Cohanzick
Management, an investment advisory firm led by David Sherman that focused on mutual
funds with shorter term debt instruments. Prior to starting Cohanzick and CrossingBridge,
Mr. Sherman was a senior executive and Treasurer of insurance operations at Leucadia. The
deal closed in August 2022. The end result was a “new company” and new management
albeit with the same ticker – ENDI (note: older SEC filings are under Sitestar while newer
ones are under ENDI Corp.). As part of the deal, CrossingBridge contributed some of its
advisory agreements in exchange for shares valued at $8 per share, leaving the new entity
with a large amount of cash and a profitable asset management business.
The costs of closing the deal hurt results in 2022 yet they still reported $0.66 in EPS. In
2023 ENDI reported EPS of $0.46 per share. The share price was languishing around $4 per
share. You might think things were trending in the wrong direction. Not at all! In fact, a
number of positive events occurred in 2023 and even more in early 2024.
On May 12, 2023, the company closed on agreement to acquire RiverPark Strategic Income
Fund, which was sub-advised by David Sherman and Cohanzick. Essentially ENDI would own
the full revenue stream from the advisory fees and pay RiverPark up to 50% of the revenue
for the next three years and then 20% of revenue in years four and five.
On October 23, 2023, ENDI launched a UCITS fund, the CrossingBridge Low Duration High
Income Fund. The fund is similar to its US Low Duration High Income Fund but is intended
for investors outside North America. The fund had reached $59 million in assets under
management (AUM) by December 31, 2023, and over $80 million by March 31, 2024.
According to the April 19, 2024, conference call this was accomplished without a seeder, and
they are yet to target large family offices.
On January 12, 2024, the company filed Form 15 to deregister with the SEC. This should
reduce professional fees.
On March 9, 2024, Crossing Bridge replaced Cohanzick as sub advisor to the RiverPark Short
Term High Yield Fund as part of a deal for ENDI to acquire all remaining assets of Cohanzick
for a $10 million note yielding 8%. This increased AUM by roughly $800 million.
ENDI has 5.47 million shares outstanding. A current price of roughly $6.50 per share, for a
$36 million market cap. Insiders own about 53%. What we felt the market was missing was
that the company was no longer what it was, and more importantly it significantly increased
earnings power based on the recent growth in AUM. Assets under management are currently
$2.9 billion versus $1.8 billion at the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion at the end of 2022. Due to
the March acquisition, true earnings power will not be reflected until the June quarter, but
we estimate 2024 earnings at $0.86 per share.
What made ENDI even more attractive was that they had cash and investments of $16.7
million, or $3.06 per share, as of the end of 2023. The most recent deal added $10 million
of debt so net cash has subsequently decreased to $1.25 per share, but cash should build
faster than earnings due to ENDI not being a full tax payer.3 We estimate March 2024 cash
3 Accounting Note: I ignore the impact of warrant liability change on reported earnings. It is one of my
least favorite accounting rules. If the stock price goes up during the quarter the company is hit with a
non-cash expense since the “cost” of the previously issued warrants is now higher. Conversely if the
stock declines in the quarter the company reports a credit to expense. The actual pricing of the warrants
remains unchanged under both scenarios.

and investments at nearly $1.50 per share. At $6.50 per share ENDI is trading at just six
times earnings net of cash.
We think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash, or $8.35
to $10 per share today with that value growing $0.25 per share every quarter. Thus, by the
end of the year we see fair value being $9.75 to $11.50 per share based on slightly higher
earnings run rate and an estimated cash balance of $2.30 per share. Unfortunately, due to
ENDI’s small size, it will be a smaller position for the fund, but big enough to be meaningful.
We should note the stock has not had much liquidity the last month or so.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 18% in the first quarter of
2024 from $15.25 per share to $18.05 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron reported its first quarter of earnings since closing its
acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily
for the medical industry. Fiscal third quarter revenue was approximately $4.1 million with
operating income of $0.2 million. Included in the quarter were one-time costs related to the
acquisition of $715,000. Thus, adjusted operating income would have been $933,000 for the
quarter.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.56 per share at the
end of 2023 to $2.71 per share at the end of the first quarter. PharmChem makes sweat
patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. Over the last
few years PharmChem spent aggressively to expand its sales force with the goal of increasing
sales in existing markets and expanding into direct-to-consumer and private employer. In
the third quarter of 2023 we eliminated spending on private employer and at the end of the
year we reduced our cost structure for direct-to-consumer. We retained the sales staff based
on how it is performing. In the first quarter we entered into a separation agreement with our
CEO who was hired in part to oversee the two initiatives that we have dialed back. Thompson
Clark, one of the board members, was named Interim CEO. In 2023, the Company was able
to repurchase shares and options that reduced diluted shares by roughly 12% and pay a
$0.20 per share dividend. 2023 earnings were $0.17 per share.
PharmChem reported Q1 earnings of $0.034 per share and that was after $100,000 of one-
time expenses. Proforma for taxes, per share earnings would have been $0.05 per share.
The CEO change will result in the elimination of PharmChem’s stock option expense and a
lower cost for the CEO role as well. I cannot provide an earnings estimate, but an investor
can figure out how the rest of the year should look.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices

Cedar Creek Partners,Tim Eriksen,"October 21, 2025",2025.0,3.0,9.9,Russell 2000,12.4,-2.5,"The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the Fund’s auditors.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

Smaller stocks performed the best in the quarter with the Russell Microcap rising 17.0% and the Russell 2000 increasing 12.4%, while the DJIA rose only 5.6%. The NASDAQ and S&P500 rose 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively in Q3. Cedar Creek was up 9.9% in the third quarter, net of fees and expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 26.5%, outperforming all the major indices we track.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ¾ year history is 14.80%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,418.1%, net of fees and expenses. Q3 ‘25 ‘25YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 9.9% 26.5% 1,418.1% 14.8% NASDAQ 11.2% 17.3% 878.0% 12.3% S&P 500 (SPY) 8.2% 14.7% 648.4% 10.8% DJIA (DIA) 5.6% 10.3% 559.3% 10.0% Russell 2000 12.4% 10.4% 349.7% 7.9% Russell Microcap 17.0% 15.7% 267.9% 6.8% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,518,112 as of September 30, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $367,933 in the Russell MicroCap and $977,972 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.2 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 As I write this, the ratios are now 6.8 times our earnings estimate and 5.2 times our estimates net of cash. Trailing earnings multiple was 12.4 times as of September 30 and is 10.6 today. Weighted price-to-book was 1.2. As I write this it is 0.9. Dividend yield was 1.5% as of September 30. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2025, was 15.4%. (note – in most of the fund’s investments, we are earnings focused and not book value or dividend yield focused.) Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 17% largely due to the sale of PharmChem (otc: PCHM) at the buyout price of $3.75 per share in September and closing out our position in Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) in July. We decided to sell our shares back to Citizens to allocate to what we felt were better opportunities. Citizens is cheap with a price-to-earnings multiple of roughly seven and certainly trades well below adjusted book value if we assume the ECIP preferred can be repurchased at 28% of face value. It has been more than three years since receiving the funds and Citizens and most other ECIP recipient banks have done little. We had expected if internal growth was not possible that the funds would be used for acquisitions, which has yet to be the case. We still believe Citizens has an incredible opportunity to grow and better serve their customer base and shareholders; however they seem too cautious in our opinion. The fund made 2-3x its investment and determined that the best course of action was to move on. Most of the proceeds were used to increase our position in Phi Group (expert: PHIG) in the $27-$28 price range. In September we received the proceeds from the PharmChem sale. We have been busy putting those funds to work. One area we particularly like is smaller community banks. We have found a number trading at 5-6 times our forward earnings estimates. We are still accumulating shares so we cannot give any specific names. We can say that they are quite similar to Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK) which we profiled in our Q1 letter, and still own. Small community bank where earnings are growing and valuation is extremely low. Then, Skyline was at $12.50 per share resulting in a market cap of just $70 million. A recent merger hid true earnings. Adjusting for merger related expense put Q4 2024 earnings at $0.61 per share or $2.45 annualized. We thought additional cost savings might be possible but at just over five times earnings, the thesis didn’t require it. Dividend yield was near 4%. We thought it should trade closer to $25, which would be just ten times earnings. Fast forward six months, earnings are likely to be $0.70 per share in Q3 plus some intangible costs resulting in cash earnings of $0.74 per share, or an annualized run rate of $2.96 per share. The stock has climbed to $17.25 per share but the price-to-earnings ratio is still under six. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 41% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders (unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly. Five positions make up about 87% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 16% of the fund, Phi Group (expert: PHIG) is 8% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 6%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund. Propel Media agreed to be purchased by Vitruvian Partners for $1.451 per share. Subsequent to quarter end we received the proceeds. There is the possibility of a further payment due to some funds in escrow. The fund’s valuation of Propel increased from $0.90 per share to $1.451 in the quarter. While the overall return on the investment was roughly six times what we invested, we had hoped for more. The deal apparently involved a lot of bonus payments to management and adjustments related to debt and working capital that took the topline number down significantly. As we noted in our last two letters, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares (nasdaq: MCBS) for cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter. As noted earlier, we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert: PHIG) during the quarter. As of today, it is nearly an 8% position. We think it is worth two to three times the most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services for the global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry. The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year. Performance Attribution Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities. Most of the fund’s performance in the third quarter was due to the increase in the valuation of our expert market positions. They increased 26% in aggregate in the quarter, primarily due to Propel Media and Phi Group. Our control stocks increased in value by just over 4% in the third quarter, while our generally undervalued securities increased 7%. Update on Our Control Positions As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have/had strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – as noted above, the sale of PharmChem closed during the third quarter. The fund was the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I served as Chairman of the Board. I took over as Chairman when an investor of the fund contributed his shares as a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a basis of $2.85 per share. The fund received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024. With a cashout price of $3.75 per share buyout price, total gross return over two years was approximately 40%. It leaves the fund with only one control position. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.75 per share to $16.40 per share during the third quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the fund manager owns 2.5% personally. While reported earnings have been soft the last few quarters due to lower revenues owing to timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing a material uptick in orders beginning in the November 2024 quarter. In the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. That quarter included a large order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the February 2025 quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of $3.1 million, and included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. In the May and August quarters bookings exceeded sales despite no orders related to HIMARS or AMRAAM. Solitron expects the next AMRAAM order to be awarded soon. Update on Other Fund Holdings ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the third quarter from $15.65 per share to $17.55 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of September 2025, AUM was in excess of $4.2 billion, an increase of over 22% in the first nine months of 2025. With short term rates falling, we think investors may move into the short-term bond category to gain higher yield than money markets. ENDI’s reported operating margins do not reflect what is happening at the company. In the September 2024, December 2024 and March 2025 quarters, operating margins were 32%, but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 46 to 48% for those quarters. In the June 2025 quarter there were additional transaction expenses which resulted in reported operating margin of only 4%. Adjusting for the non-cash amortization and the one-time transaction fees, operating margin would have been 49%. While we don’t normally like adjusted EBITDA, the company’s reported number in the second quarter shows the continued improvement in the business as it rose from $2.2 million in Q1 to $3.0 million in Q2. During the second quarter ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction. We think it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge as of the end of 2024 and provides additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. We discussed it in our second quarter letter. Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute (which is what you ideally want in all your equity investments). We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that, q n u aM ANFM ANFM A u m r te r e n a y - 2 3 u g - 2 3 o v - 2 3 e b - 2 4 a y - 2 4 u g - 2 4 o v - 2 4 e b - 2 5 a y - 2 5 u g - 2 5 b e r s a d r e S o lit r N e t S 2 2 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 3 in 0 0 0 o n D a le s ,0 3 8 ,5 7 9 ,1 3 6 ,0 0 4 ,9 6 7 ,5 8 1 ,3 6 9 ,1 3 1 ,7 0 0 ,9 8 6 's e v ic e s In B o o k in 3 ,5 2 ,2 4 ,8 2 ,2 2 ,0 1 ,7 8 ,0 8 ,9 2 ,7 4 ,3 cg4 3424 5419 2 .s0 1251 2977 4 B a c k 9 8 1 2 1 1 9 7 1 2 1 8 1 8 1 8 lo ,1 ,7,9,2,2 ,5,2,1,2 ,6 g3 8808 7706 4 3 4671 2780 2 based on their recent growth rate, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per share versus the current $17.50 share price.3 The sale of 25% of CrossingBridge increased net cash to $43 million, or $36 million net of the non-controlling interest portion at CrossingBridge, which equates to $6.75 per share using the smaller figure. This provides some downside protection while also giving management funds to use for accretive acquisitions. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices followed a strong second quarter with a strong third quarter. Smaller stocks
performed the best in the quarter with the Russell Microcap rising 17.0% and the Russell 2000
increasing 12.4%, while the DJIA rose only 5.6%. The NASDAQ and S&P500 rose 11.2% and
8.2%, respectively in Q3. Cedar Creek was up 9.9% in the third quarter, net of fees and
expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 26.5%, outperforming all the major indices we
track.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ¾ year history is 14.80%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,418.1%, net of fees and expenses.

1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!

return on equity as of September 30, 2025, was 15.4%. (note – in most of the fund’s
investments, we are earnings focused and not book value or dividend yield focused.)
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 17% largely due to
the sale of PharmChem (otc: PCHM) at the buyout price of $3.75 per share in September
and closing out our position in Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) in July. We decided to sell
our shares back to Citizens to allocate to what we felt were better opportunities. Citizens is
cheap with a price-to-earnings multiple of roughly seven and certainly trades well below
adjusted book value if we assume the ECIP preferred can be repurchased at 28% of face
value. It has been more than three years since receiving the funds and Citizens and most
other ECIP recipient banks have done little. We had expected if internal growth was not
possible that the funds would be used for acquisitions, which has yet to be the case. We still
believe Citizens has an incredible opportunity to grow and better serve their customer base
and shareholders; however they seem too cautious in our opinion. The fund made 2-3x its
investment and determined that the best course of action was to move on. Most of the
proceeds were used to increase our position in Phi Group (expert: PHIG) in the $27-$28
price range.
In September we received the proceeds from the PharmChem sale. We have been busy
putting those funds to work. One area we particularly like is smaller community banks. We
have found a number trading at 5-6 times our forward earnings estimates. We are still
accumulating shares so we cannot give any specific names. We can say that they are quite
similar to Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK) which we profiled in our Q1 letter, and still own.
Small community bank where earnings are growing and valuation is extremely low. Then,
Skyline was at $12.50 per share resulting in a market cap of just $70 million. A recent
merger hid true earnings. Adjusting for merger related expense put Q4 2024 earnings at
$0.61 per share or $2.45 annualized. We thought additional cost savings might be possible

We thought it should trade closer to $25, which would be just ten times earnings. Fast
forward six months, earnings are likely to be $0.70 per share in Q3 plus some intangible
costs resulting in cash earnings of $0.74 per share, or an annualized run rate of $2.96 per
share. The stock has climbed to $17.25 per share but the price-to-earnings ratio is still under
six.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 41% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending
on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders
(unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website,

the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust

sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just
shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly.
Five positions make up about 87% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 16% of the fund, Phi Group (expert: PHIG) is 8% of the fund, First
IC (expert: FIEB) is 6%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil
Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund.
Propel Media agreed to be purchased by Vitruvian Partners for $1.451 per share. Subsequent
to quarter end we received the proceeds. There is the possibility of a further payment due
to some funds in escrow. The fund’s valuation of Propel increased from $0.90 per share to
$1.451 in the quarter. While the overall return on the investment was roughly six times what
we invested, we had hoped for more. The deal apparently involved a lot of bonus payments
to management and adjustments related to debt and working capital that took the topline
number down significantly.
As we noted in our last two letters, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares
(nasdaq: MCBS) for cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary
shareholder and regulatory approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close
early in the fourth quarter.
As noted earlier, we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert: PHIG) during
the quarter. As of today, it is nearly an 8% position. We think it is worth two to three times
the most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services
for the global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry.
The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was
primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently
focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company
had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year.
Performance Attribution
Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert
market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have
greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities.
Most of the fund’s performance in the third quarter was due to the increase in the valuation
of our expert market positions. They increased 26% in aggregate in the quarter, primarily
due to Propel Media and Phi Group. Our control stocks increased in value by just over 4% in
the third quarter, while our generally undervalued securities increased 7%.
Update on Our Control Positions
As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a
position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what
he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have/had strong independent boards, which is the
way it should be at all companies.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – as noted above, the sale of PharmChem closed during the third
quarter. The fund was the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I served as
Chairman of the Board. I took over as Chairman when an investor of the fund contributed
his shares as a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a basis of $2.85 per share. The fund
received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024. With a cashout price of $3.75 per share
buyout price, total gross return over two years was approximately 40%. It leaves the fund
with only one control position.

Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.75 per share to
$16.40 per share during the third quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a
board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the
fund manager owns 2.5% personally.
While reported earnings have been soft the last
few quarters due to lower revenues owing to
timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing
a material uptick in orders beginning in the
November 2024 quarter. In the fiscal third
quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings
were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of
$3.4 million. That quarter included a large order
for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket
System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s
second largest defense customer. In the fiscal
fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025, Solitron
did even better. Bookings in the February 2025 quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of
$3.1 million, and included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX
(formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components.
In the May and August quarters bookings exceeded sales despite no orders related to HIMARS
or AMRAAM. Solitron expects the next AMRAAM order to be awarded soon.
Update on Other Fund Holdings
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share
price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the third quarter from $15.65
per share to $17.55 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed
income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for
CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted
for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of
2024. According to their website, as of the end of September 2025, AUM was in excess of
$4.2 billion, an increase of over 22% in the first nine months of 2025. With short term rates
falling, we think investors may move into the short-term bond category to gain higher yield
than money markets.
ENDI’s reported operating margins do not reflect what is happening at the company. In the
September 2024, December 2024 and March 2025 quarters, operating margins were 32%,
but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition
of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin
was 46 to 48% for those quarters. In the June 2025 quarter there were additional transaction
expenses which resulted in reported operating margin of only 4%. Adjusting for the non-
cash amortization and the one-time transaction fees, operating margin would have been
49%. While we don’t normally like adjusted EBITDA, the company’s reported number in the
second quarter shows the continued improvement in the business as it rose from $2.2 million
in Q1 to $3.0 million in Q2.
During the second quarter ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange
for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities
affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction. We think
it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge as of the end of 2024 and provides
additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. We discussed
it in our second quarter letter.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute (which is what
you ideally want in all your equity investments). We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that,

based on their recent growth rate, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash
seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net
cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per share versus the current $17.50
share price.3 The sale of 25% of CrossingBridge increased net cash to $43 million, or $36
million net of the non-controlling interest portion at CrossingBridge, which equates to $6.75
per share using the smaller figure. This provides some downside protection while also giving
management funds to use for accretive acquisitions.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have

Smaller stocks performed the best in the quarter with the Russell Microcap rising 17.0% and the Russell 2000 increasing 12.4%, while the DJIA rose only 5.6%. The NASDAQ and S&P500 rose 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively in Q3. Cedar Creek was up 9.9% in the third quarter, net of fees and expenses. Year to date, Cedar Creek was up 26.5%, outperforming all the major indices we track.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 19 ¾ year history is 14.80%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,418.1%, net of fees and expenses.

Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,518,112 as of September 30, 2025, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $367,933 in the Russell MicroCap and $977,972 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2025, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.2 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 As I write this, the ratios are now 6.8 times our earnings estimate and 5.2 times our estimates net of cash. Trailing earnings multiple was 12.4 times as of September 30 and is 10.6 today. Weighted price-to-book was 1.2. As I write this it is 0.9. Dividend yield was 1.5% as of September 30. Weighted expected return on equity as of September 30, 2025, was 15.4%. (note – in most of the fund’s investments, we are earnings focused and not book value or dividend yield focused.) Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 17% largely due to the sale of PharmChem (otc: PCHM) at the buyout price of $3.75 per share in September and closing out our position in Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) in July. We decided to sell our shares back to Citizens to allocate to what we felt were better opportunities. Citizens is cheap with a price-to-earnings multiple of roughly seven and certainly trades well below adjusted book value if we assume the ECIP preferred can be repurchased at 28% of face value. It has been more than three years since receiving the funds and Citizens and most other ECIP recipient banks have done little. We had expected if internal growth was not possible that the funds would be used for acquisitions, which has yet to be the case. We still believe Citizens has an incredible opportunity to grow and better serve their customer base and shareholders; however they seem too cautious in our opinion. The fund made 2-3x its investment and determined that the best course of action was to move on. Most of the proceeds were used to increase our position in Phi Group (expert: PHIG) in the $27-$28 price range. In September we received the proceeds from the PharmChem sale. We have been busy putting those funds to work. One area we particularly like is smaller community banks. We have found a number trading at 5-6 times our forward earnings estimates. We are still accumulating shares so we cannot give any specific names. We can say that they are quite similar to Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK) which we profiled in our Q1 letter, and still own. Small community bank where earnings are growing and valuation is extremely low. Then, Skyline was at $12.50 per share resulting in a market cap of just $70 million. A recent merger hid true earnings. Adjusting for merger related expense put Q4 2024 earnings at $0.61 per share or $2.45 annualized. We thought additional cost savings might be possible but at just over five times earnings, the thesis didn’t require it. Dividend yield was near 4%. We thought it should trade closer to $25, which would be just ten times earnings. Fast forward six months, earnings are likely to be $0.70 per share in Q3 plus some intangible costs resulting in cash earnings of $0.74 per share, or an annualized run rate of $2.96 per share. The stock has climbed to $17.25 per share but the price-to-earnings ratio is still under six. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 41% of the fund. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules. There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders (unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website, sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly. Five positions make up about 87% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media (expert: PROM) is about 16% of the fund, Phi Group (expert: PHIG) is 8% of the fund, First IC (expert: FIEB) is 6%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund. Propel Media agreed to be purchased by Vitruvian Partners for $1.451 per share. Subsequent to quarter end we received the proceeds. There is the possibility of a further payment due to some funds in escrow. The fund’s valuation of Propel increased from $0.90 per share to $1.451 in the quarter. While the overall return on the investment was roughly six times what we invested, we had hoped for more. The deal apparently involved a lot of bonus payments to management and adjustments related to debt and working capital that took the topline number down significantly. As we noted in our last two letters, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares (nasdaq: MCBS) for cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter. As noted earlier, we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert: PHIG) during the quarter. As of today, it is nearly an 8% position. We think it is worth two to three times the most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services for the global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry. The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year. Performance Attribution Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities. Most of the fund’s performance in the third quarter was due to the increase in the valuation of our expert market positions. They increased 26% in aggregate in the quarter, primarily due to Propel Media and Phi Group. Our control stocks increased in value by just over 4% in the third quarter, while our generally undervalued securities increased 7%. Update on Our Control Positions As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have/had strong independent boards, which is the way it should be at all companies. PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – as noted above, the sale of PharmChem closed during the third quarter. The fund was the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I served as Chairman of the Board. I took over as Chairman when an investor of the fund contributed his shares as a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a basis of $2.85 per share. The fund received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024. With a cashout price of $3.75 per share buyout price, total gross return over two years was approximately 40%. It leaves the fund with only one control position. Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.75 per share to $16.40 per share during the third quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the fund manager owns 2.5% personally. While reported earnings have been soft the last few quarters due to lower revenues owing to timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing a material uptick in orders beginning in the November 2024 quarter. In the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of $3.4 million. That quarter included a large order for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s second largest defense customer. In the fiscal fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025, Solitron did even better. Bookings in the February 2025 quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of $3.1 million, and included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX (formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components. In the May and August quarters bookings exceeded sales despite no orders related to HIMARS or AMRAAM. Solitron expects the next AMRAAM order to be awarded soon. Update on Other Fund Holdings ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the third quarter from $15.65 per share to $17.55 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of 2024. According to their website, as of the end of September 2025, AUM was in excess of $4.2 billion, an increase of over 22% in the first nine months of 2025. With short term rates falling, we think investors may move into the short-term bond category to gain higher yield than money markets. ENDI’s reported operating margins do not reflect what is happening at the company. In the September 2024, December 2024 and March 2025 quarters, operating margins were 32%, but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin was 46 to 48% for those quarters. In the June 2025 quarter there were additional transaction expenses which resulted in reported operating margin of only 4%. Adjusting for the non-cash amortization and the one-time transaction fees, operating margin would have been 49%. While we don’t normally like adjusted EBITDA, the company’s reported number in the second quarter shows the continued improvement in the business as it rose from $2.2 million in Q1 to $3.0 million in Q2. During the second quarter ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million.

We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 17% largely due to
the sale of PharmChem (otc: PCHM) at the buyout price of $3.75 per share in September
and closing out our position in Citizens Bancshares (otc: CZBS) in July. We decided to sell
our shares back to Citizens to allocate to what we felt were better opportunities. Citizens is
cheap with a price-to-earnings multiple of roughly seven and certainly trades well below
adjusted book value if we assume the ECIP preferred can be repurchased at 28% of face
value. It has been more than three years since receiving the funds and Citizens and most
other ECIP recipient banks have done little. We had expected if internal growth was not
possible that the funds would be used for acquisitions, which has yet to be the case. We still
believe Citizens has an incredible opportunity to grow and better serve their customer base
and shareholders; however they seem too cautious in our opinion. The fund made 2-3x its
investment and determined that the best course of action was to move on. Most of the
proceeds were used to increase our position in Phi Group (expert: PHIG) in the $27-$28
price range.
In September we received the proceeds from the PharmChem sale. We have been busy
putting those funds to work. One area we particularly like is smaller community banks. We
have found a number trading at 5-6 times our forward earnings estimates. We are still
accumulating shares so we cannot give any specific names. We can say that they are quite
similar to Skyline Bankshares (otc: SLBK) which we profiled in our Q1 letter, and still own.
Small community bank where earnings are growing and valuation is extremely low. Then,
Skyline was at $12.50 per share resulting in a market cap of just $70 million. A recent
merger hid true earnings. Adjusting for merger related expense put Q4 2024 earnings at
$0.61 per share or $2.45 annualized. We thought additional cost savings might be possible
but at just over five times earnings, the thesis didn’t require it. Dividend yield was near 4%.
We thought it should trade closer to $25, which would be just ten times earnings. Fast
forward six months, earnings are likely to be $0.70 per share in Q3 plus some intangible
costs resulting in cash earnings of $0.74 per share, or an annualized run rate of $2.96 per
share. The stock has climbed to $17.25 per share but the price-to-earnings ratio is still under
six.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased to 41% of the fund. Expert
market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule
prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also
restricts transactions for retail customers to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending
on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. Them’s the rules.
There are a wide range of differences among “non-reporting” companies. Some are
completely dark – meaning they do not communicate any financial results to shareholders
(unless forced to under law). Others update quarterly or annually on their website,
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings or book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL). We did not include excess capital of our ECIP bank holdings as excess cash.

sometimes behind a password login. Others mail annual results out to shareholders, or just
shareholders of record, but do not post them publicly.
Five positions make up about 87% of the fund’s expert market exposure – Propel Media
(expert: PROM) is about 16% of the fund, Phi Group (expert: PHIG) is 8% of the fund, First
IC (expert: FIEB) is 6%, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (expert: PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil
Trust (expert: ROYTL) are each roughly 3% of the fund.
Propel Media agreed to be purchased by Vitruvian Partners for $1.451 per share. Subsequent
to quarter end we received the proceeds. There is the possibility of a further payment due
to some funds in escrow. The fund’s valuation of Propel increased from $0.90 per share to
$1.451 in the quarter. While the overall return on the investment was roughly six times what
we invested, we had hoped for more. The deal apparently involved a lot of bonus payments
to management and adjustments related to debt and working capital that took the topline
number down significantly.
As we noted in our last two letters, First IC is being acquired by MetroCity Bankshares
(nasdaq: MCBS) for cash and stock. As of July 15, the deal has received all necessary
shareholder and regulatory approvals. According to MetroCity, the deal is expected to close
early in the fourth quarter.
As noted earlier, we significantly increased our position in PHI Group (expert: PHIG) during
the quarter. As of today, it is nearly an 8% position. We think it is worth two to three times
the most recent trading price. PHI Group is a leading provider of helicopter flight services
for the global oil and gas exploration and production industry and the air medical industry.
The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection in September 2019. The bankruptcy was
primarily due to excessive debt rather than poor financial performance. PHI has subsequently
focused on improving its margins and prioritizing a conservative balance sheet. The Company
had filed an S-1 registration statement but withdrew it in May of this year.
Performance Attribution
Last quarter we noted that we currently think of the fund as having three categories: expert
market stocks, control positions (where the fund manager is on the board and can have
greater influence over decision making), and generally undervalued securities.
Most of the fund’s performance in the third quarter was due to the increase in the valuation
of our expert market positions. They increased 26% in aggregate in the quarter, primarily
due to Propel Media and Phi Group. Our control stocks increased in value by just over 4% in
the third quarter, while our generally undervalued securities increased 7%.
Update on Our Control Positions
As we noted above, by control, we mean that the fund manager is on the Board or in a
position to significantly influence decision making, not that he has total control and gets what
he wants. Both Solitron and PharmChem have/had strong independent boards, which is the
way it should be at all companies.
PharmChem (otc: PCHM) – as noted above, the sale of PharmChem closed during the third
quarter. The fund was the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I served as
Chairman of the Board. I took over as Chairman when an investor of the fund contributed
his shares as a contribution-in-kind in August 2023 with a basis of $2.85 per share. The fund
received a $0.25 per share dividend in October 2024. With a cashout price of $3.75 per share
buyout price, total gross return over two years was approximately 40%. It leaves the fund
with only one control position.

Solitron Devices (otc: SODI) - the bid price for shares increased from $15.75 per share to
$16.40 per share during the third quarter. As a reminder, the fund manager is CEO and a
board member of Solitron. The fund owns 11.6% of Solitron’s outstanding shares and the
fund manager owns 2.5% personally.
While reported earnings have been soft the last
few quarters due to lower revenues owing to
timing of receipt of orders, Solitron started seeing
a material uptick in orders beginning in the
November 2024 quarter. In the fiscal third
quarter ending November 30, 2024, bookings
were $8.0 million in the quarter, versus sales of
$3.4 million. That quarter included a large order
for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket
System) components from L3Harris – Solitron’s
second largest defense customer. In the fiscal
fourth quarter ending February 28, 2025, Solitron
did even better. Bookings in the February 2025 quarter were $8.9 million versus sales of
$3.1 million, and included over $5 million from Solitron’s largest defense customer, RTX
(formerly Raytheon) for AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) components.
In the May and August quarters bookings exceeded sales despite no orders related to HIMARS
or AMRAAM. Solitron expects the next AMRAAM order to be awarded soon.
Update on Other Fund Holdings
ENDI Corp (otc: ENDI) – we profiled ENDI in our 2024 first quarter letter when the share
price was around $6.50 per share. The share price rose during the third quarter from $15.65
per share to $17.55 per share. ENDI owns CrossingBridge Advisors which manages fixed
income mutual funds and a few managed accounts. Assets under management (AUM) for
CrossingBridge grew over 30% in 2024, from $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024, adjusted
for the acquisition of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield Fund, to $3.4 billion at the end of
2024. According to their website, as of the end of September 2025, AUM was in excess of
$4.2 billion, an increase of over 22% in the first nine months of 2025. With short term rates
falling, we think investors may move into the short-term bond category to gain higher yield
than money markets.
ENDI’s reported operating margins do not reflect what is happening at the company. In the
September 2024, December 2024 and March 2025 quarters, operating margins were 32%,
but that is misleading. ENDI incurs significant amortization charges related to its acquisition
of CrossingBridge and other investment management contracts. Adjusted operating margin
was 46 to 48% for those quarters. In the June 2025 quarter there were additional transaction
expenses which resulted in reported operating margin of only 4%. Adjusting for the non-
cash amortization and the one-time transaction fees, operating margin would have been
49%. While we don’t normally like adjusted EBITDA, the company’s reported number in the
second quarter shows the continued improvement in the business as it rose from $2.2 million
in Q1 to $3.0 million in Q2.
During the second quarter ENDI announced a cash investment in CrossingBridge in exchange
for 25% membership interest. The price was $25.9 million. The fund, and other entities
affiliated with the fund manager, including Solitron, participated in the transaction. We think
it is a win-win deal. It shows the value of CrossingBridge as of the end of 2024 and provides
additional capital to good capital allocators to grow assets under management. We discussed
it in our second quarter letter.
Our fair value estimate just keeps rising as the company continues to execute (which is what
you ideally want in all your equity investments). We wrote in our 2024 yearend letter that,

based on their recent growth rate, a valuation of 12 to 15 times cash earnings plus net cash
seems more reasonable. Using 12 to 15 times the current run rate of cash earnings plus net
cash would result in a value between $21.85 and $26.50 per share versus the current $17.50
share price.3 The sale of 25% of CrossingBridge increased net cash to $43 million, or $36
million net of the non-controlling interest portion at CrossingBridge, which equates to $6.75
per share using the smaller figure. This provides some downside protection while also giving
management funds to use for accretive acquisitions.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2025 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.
Forward Looking Statements
This letter and the accompanying discussion include forward-looking statements. All statements that are

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund declined 9.9% in the second quarter and is down 16.5% year-to-date. By contrast, the
Russell Microcap Index lost 19.0% this quarter and has fallen 25.1% in 2022. It’s ugly out there. At
the halfway point of the year, global stock markets have recorded one of their worst performances
in modern market history. Fortunately for us and in keeping with the historical pattern, Alluvial
Fund has managed to avoid a portion of the decline. Our holdings, with their robust balance
sheets and durable cash flows, have fared far better than the hyper-growth (and hypo-profit) story
stocks that investors bid to dizzying heights last year. Nevertheless, our holdings are public. They
rise and fall on the whims of investors. And investors sure are a capricious bunch. When mounting
stress and fear cause the stock market to tumble, our holdings are not wholly unaffected.

I don’t worry about falling stock prices. I don’t enjoy them by any means, but they don’t keep me
up at night. What I do worry about is permanent loss of capital. There are a variety of ways to
achieve a permanent loss, but at the heart of each is the same error: over-paying. There’s a school
of thought, a very popular one at present, that says investors should spend all their time identifying
the market’s highest quality companies and ignore all the rest. And that once these paragons of
virtue are found, nearly any price can be paid for their shares and a good outcome assured. I am
not a subscriber. I am willing to invest in average or even sub-par businesses, provided they are
priced so modestly that a large margin of safety exists. A company does not have to dominate
its industry, invent the next iPhone, or become a global household name for shareholders to earn
an outstanding return. Indeed, a company can do all these things and still deliver only middling
returns if the achievements were priced in from the beginning. I would rather spend time finding
situations where the market’s expectations of a company are so low (or barely exist at all) that even
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

modest success means a much higher stock price. It’s much tougher to over-pay for a company
where the market expects little than to over-pay for one from which the market expects continuous
and unbounded success. Now, investing in low expectations companies and securities is not for
the impatient. But neither is Alluvial Fund.
The Rundown
Our portfolio’s holdings are relatively unchanged from last quarter, but multiple companies
reported meaningful positive developments. The market doesn’t care, but that is the normal state
of affairs during bear markets. When the fear subsides, fundamentals will matter once again.
P10 Inc.
In June, I attended the P10 shareholder meeting in Dallas. Co-CEO Robert Alpert presided and
did a fine job providing an overview of the company’s initiatives and fielding questions from the
handful of investors in attendance. I asked if P10 were considering how to add permanent capital
vehicles to its assets under management, and the answer was an enthusiastic “Yes.” So I was
pleased to see the company announce a large indirect investment in Crossroads Impact Corp.
Crossroads will serve as a growing source of permanent capital for P10’s impact investing platform,
Enhanced Capital. The upshot is additional high-margin, recurring revenue for P10.
P10 has traded down this year in sympathy with other alternative asset managers. However, the
firm continues to grow its base of contractually guaranteed fee revenue. A murkier economic
outlook makes fund-raising more challenging, but it will not permanently dampen P10’s prospects.
Shares are worth at least $18 (50% upside from here) and more if the company can execute on
acquisition opportunities.
Unidata S.p.A.
If there is a bull market to be found, it may be in grim headlines from Europe. Energy woes. A
looming recession. Resigning premieres. It comes as no surprise that investors have done an about
face on several of our European holdings despite dirt cheap valuations and long-term industry
tailwinds. But a continental recession, even a deep one, will not bring the expansion of broadband
internet in Italy to a halt. Unidata keeps on hustling to build out its network, and the customer list
keeps growing. Most recently, Unidata announced a joint venture with an infrastructure fund to co-
develop and manage one of Italy’s first energy efficient data centers. Creative moves like this will
enable Unidata to roughly double its cash flow by 2025. I expect shares to reach €100 well before
then.
Garrett Motion Preferreds
Garrett Motion is an exercise in patience. Just as it seemed the global automotive market
was about to recover to pre-COVID production, along came Russia, inflation, and the threat of
recession. Still, the company is making great strides in improving and simplifying its balance sheet.
In June, the company redeemed the rest of the Series B preferred shares it issued to Honeywell
when it exited bankruptcy in 2021. With the Series Bs out of the way, Garrett Motion is free to
dedicate its cash flow to continued deleveraging or share buybacks. At some point in the next year
or two, the conditions will be met for Garrett Motion to convert these preferreds and simplify their
capital structure. If the market stubbornly refuses to value Garrett Motion shares at a reasonable
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

price, I believe the company will pursue a sale or merger. Until then, our preferred shares will
continue to accrue dividends at an attractive yield. The preferreds are worth at least $15 today,
and possibly $20 or more if the company can reduce leverage and/or buy back shares and the
automotive market recovers.
Pegroco Invest AB Preferreds
As expected, Pegroco has resumed paying quarterly dividends on its preferred shares. However,
the company has yet to pay out the arrearage that built up while COVID ravaged the economy.
This arrearage continues to build and now exceeds SEK 24 per share. At SEK 110, Pegroco
preferreds offer a distribution yield of 8.6%,
with investors to receive an additional

poor market conditions, the company
announced it would delay the planned IPO
of its e-commerce logistics company 3PL. TIM has gone from “very cheap” to “wildly cheap”
this year. The market is too focused on near-term headwinds in TIM’s electronic components
distribution business and is missing the continued growth and huge market opportunity at 3PL.
Management apparently agrees and has announced a repurchase plan covering 14% of TIM’s
shares outstanding. With Polish investors as morose as they have been in years, it could take time
for TIM shares to rebound. But the market cannot ignore TIM’s profitability and growth forever.
Introducing Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust
We have a new holding in Copper Property Pass Through Trust. That’s a bit of a mouthful, so
we’ll call it “CPT.” CPT is a highly attractive liquidation opportunity. CPT was created out of the
JC Penney bankruptcy to own a variety of JC Penney’s store properties and distribution centers.
CPT is a liquidating trust tasked with selling off all 146 remaining properties within three years and
distributing monthly net rents received until then. These properties are on an 18-year triple net
master lease to New JC Penney. The reorganized JC Penney is well-financed and profitable.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

CPT’s market capitalization is $956 million. The trust has a small cash balance and zero debt. Gross
annual rents from JC Penney are $111 million. After the cost of management fees and sales effort-
related expenses, the trust distributes nearly $100 million to holders annually. This 10%+ yield is
simply too high for a geographically diversified collection of commercial properties on long-term
triple net lease to a good quality tenant. Today trust units are changing hands at around $12.75.
Ultimately, I expect us to receive liquidation proceeds of $18 or more within three years, plus $1.30
per share in annualized distributions for an internal rate of return of at least 20%. The faster that
CPT winds up, the better the outcome. Know anyone who wants to buy some real estate?
Expert Market Fireworks
Since last year’s SEC rule change that effectively eliminated public quotation of non-SEC reporting
securities, we have continued to hold a select few of the affected stocks, viewing them as quasi-
permanent holdings. These are high-quality companies with competent, well-aligned management
teams. The kind of holdings you can tuck away in a portfolio for a decade or longer with full
confidence that the value of your investment is growing at an attractive rate. I know we won’t
often hear from these companies, but they
will occasionally surprise us with positive
developments. It’s an exciting day when an TABLE III: World Allocation, 6/30/22 (%)

limits of Boston ensures it will enjoy steady demand for its products for decades to come. If sold,
Boston Sand & Gravel would fetch at least $1,800 per share. It won’t be sold any time soon. But
even families adamantly against selling sometimes change course when a generational transition
happens or a seller simply makes a generous offer. That’s what happened with Ash Grove Cement
a few years back. Until then, we will enjoy a growing stream of dividends and a more and more
profitable and valuable Boston Sand & Gravel under the experienced leadership of the Boylan
family.
Another Alluvial Fund expert market holding making waves is Cuisine Solutions, an innovator in
food technology. Unlike a lot of “innovators,” Cuisine Solutions manages to be highly profitable
while dedicating millions to research and development. The company has spent the last few
years constructing new state of the art facilities to produce its sous vide items for sale at Costco
and Starbucks, and for use by several airlines and restaurant chains. Turns out it wasn’t just a
few eccentric investors who noticed. In June, Bain Capital stepped up to invest $250 million in
convertible preferred stock, valuing Cuisine Solutions at over $1 billion. Bain’s investment provides

ample capital for expansion and sets the company on a path to an IPO and exchange listing
in a few years. To my amazement, we have been able to acquire quite a few additional Cuisine
Solutions shares since the announcement at prices 60% below the conversion price of Bain’s
investment. I expect to Cuisine Solutions to reward us richly in the coming years. Until then, if you

Concluding Thoughts and Updates
As I stated at the beginning of this letter, it’s ugly out there. Given the prevailing uncertainty,
investors are reluctant to commit new funds to any companies facing short-term headwinds. But
that’s not all bad. The market is offering us a chance to invest in many different companies at
shockingly low multiples of profits a few years out. That doesn’t mean these same shares won’t
experience further declines, or that they will regain all their lost ground quickly once economic
sentiment and conditions improve. Investor confidence, once it is gone, takes time to return. But I
have little doubt that buying shares of high-quality enterprises at mid-single digit multiples of 2025
earnings or free cash flows will prove as rewarding as ever over a reasonable time frame. I have
been very willing to “provide liquidity” to some panicky sellers in stocks I know well, and I expect
these purchases will work out very well once some of the fear subsides.
I thank you for your confidence in Alluvial Fund. This month we welcomed our largest investment
by a new partner in multiple years, and several other new and existing partners stepped up with
additional capital for investment in the quarter. I continue to hold my entire investable assets within
Alluvial Fund.
I welcome questions from partners about our portfolio and strategy. Please do not hesitate to
reach out by phone or e-mail. Expect to receive details about an upcoming webinar in the next few
weeks.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund declined 9.9% in the second quarter and is down 16.5% year-to-date. By contrast, the
Russell Microcap Index lost 19.0% this quarter and has fallen 25.1% in 2022. It’s ugly out there. At
the halfway point of the year, global stock markets have recorded one of their worst performances
in modern market history. Fortunately for us and in keeping with the historical pattern, Alluvial
Fund has managed to avoid a portion of the decline. Our holdings, with their robust balance
sheets and durable cash flows, have fared far better than the hyper-growth (and hypo-profit) story
stocks that investors bid to dizzying heights last year. Nevertheless, our holdings are public. They
rise and fall on the whims of investors. And investors sure are a capricious bunch. When mounting
stress and fear cause the stock market to tumble, our holdings are not wholly unaffected.

I don’t worry about falling stock prices. I don’t enjoy them by any means, but they don’t keep me
up at night. What I do worry about is permanent loss of capital. There are a variety of ways to
achieve a permanent loss, but at the heart of each is the same error: over-paying. There’s a school
of thought, a very popular one at present, that says investors should spend all their time identifying
the market’s highest quality companies and ignore all the rest. And that once these paragons of
virtue are found, nearly any price can be paid for their shares and a good outcome assured. I am
not a subscriber. I am willing to invest in average or even sub-par businesses, provided they are
priced so modestly that a large margin of safety exists. A company does not have to dominate
its industry, invent the next iPhone, or become a global household name for shareholders to earn
an outstanding return. Indeed, a company can do all these things and still deliver only middling
returns if the achievements were priced in from the beginning. I would rather spend time finding
situations where the market’s expectations of a company are so low (or barely exist at all) that even
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

modest success means a much higher stock price. It’s much tougher to over-pay for a company
where the market expects little than to over-pay for one from which the market expects continuous
and unbounded success. Now, investing in low expectations companies and securities is not for
the impatient. But neither is Alluvial Fund.
The Rundown
Our portfolio’s holdings are relatively unchanged from last quarter, but multiple companies
reported meaningful positive developments. The market doesn’t care, but that is the normal state
of affairs during bear markets. When the fear subsides, fundamentals will matter once again.
P10 Inc.
In June, I attended the P10 shareholder meeting in Dallas. Co-CEO Robert Alpert presided and
did a fine job providing an overview of the company’s initiatives and fielding questions from the
handful of investors in attendance. I asked if P10 were considering how to add permanent capital
vehicles to its assets under management, and the answer was an enthusiastic “Yes.” So I was
pleased to see the company announce a large indirect investment in Crossroads Impact Corp.
Crossroads will serve as a growing source of permanent capital for P10’s impact investing platform,
Enhanced Capital. The upshot is additional high-margin, recurring revenue for P10.
P10 has traded down this year in sympathy with other alternative asset managers. However, the
firm continues to grow its base of contractually guaranteed fee revenue. A murkier economic
outlook makes fund-raising more challenging, but it will not permanently dampen P10’s prospects.
Shares are worth at least $18 (50% upside from here) and more if the company can execute on
acquisition opportunities.
Unidata S.p.A.
If there is a bull market to be found, it may be in grim headlines from Europe. Energy woes. A
looming recession. Resigning premieres. It comes as no surprise that investors have done an about
face on several of our European holdings despite dirt cheap valuations and long-term industry
tailwinds. But a continental recession, even a deep one, will not bring the expansion of broadband
internet in Italy to a halt. Unidata keeps on hustling to build out its network, and the customer list
keeps growing. Most recently, Unidata announced a joint venture with an infrastructure fund to co-
develop and manage one of Italy’s first energy efficient data centers. Creative moves like this will
enable Unidata to roughly double its cash flow by 2025. I expect shares to reach €100 well before
then.
Garrett Motion Preferreds
Garrett Motion is an exercise in patience. Just as it seemed the global automotive market
was about to recover to pre-COVID production, along came Russia, inflation, and the threat of
recession. Still, the company is making great strides in improving and simplifying its balance sheet.
In June, the company redeemed the rest of the Series B preferred shares it issued to Honeywell
when it exited bankruptcy in 2021. With the Series Bs out of the way, Garrett Motion is free to
dedicate its cash flow to continued deleveraging or share buybacks. At some point in the next year
or two, the conditions will be met for Garrett Motion to convert these preferreds and simplify their
capital structure. If the market stubbornly refuses to value Garrett Motion shares at a reasonable
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

price, I believe the company will pursue a sale or merger. Until then, our preferred shares will
continue to accrue dividends at an attractive yield. The preferreds are worth at least $15 today,
and possibly $20 or more if the company can reduce leverage and/or buy back shares and the
automotive market recovers.
Pegroco Invest AB Preferreds
As expected, Pegroco has resumed paying quarterly dividends on its preferred shares. However,
the company has yet to pay out the arrearage that built up while COVID ravaged the economy.
This arrearage continues to build and now exceeds SEK 24 per share. At SEK 110, Pegroco
preferreds offer a distribution yield of 8.6%,
with investors to receive an additional

dividend of 22% of the trading price at some
P10 Inc. 13.8
point in the future. Pegroco’s asset value
covers the preferred and dividends in arrears
Unidata S.p.A. 10.3
several times over, and Pegroco has recently
Rand Worldwide Inc. 5.8
taken steps to monetize a few investments
and build liquidity. Pegroco is an example of Garrett Motion Inc. 5.4
a special situation that has worked very well
Butler National Corp. 5.1
for Alluvial Fund, but we’re not quite done
here. LICT Corporation 4.9
Crawford United Corp. 4.8
TIM S.A.
Poor TIM. Despite continued excellent GEE Group Inc. 4.4
results, shares have been trashed as the
Harbor Diversified Inc. 3.9
Polish construction market slows. The market
now values TIM at just 4x my estimate of Pegroco Invest AB 3.5
operating income as of June 30. Citing
Total, Top Ten 62.0%
poor market conditions, the company
announced it would delay the planned IPO
of its e-commerce logistics company 3PL. TIM has gone from “very cheap” to “wildly cheap”
this year. The market is too focused on near-term headwinds in TIM’s electronic components
distribution business and is missing the continued growth and huge market opportunity at 3PL.
Management apparently agrees and has announced a repurchase plan covering 14% of TIM’s
shares outstanding. With Polish investors as morose as they have been in years, it could take time
for TIM shares to rebound. But the market cannot ignore TIM’s profitability and growth forever.
Introducing Copper Property CTL Pass Through Trust
We have a new holding in Copper Property Pass Through Trust. That’s a bit of a mouthful, so
we’ll call it “CPT.” CPT is a highly attractive liquidation opportunity. CPT was created out of the
JC Penney bankruptcy to own a variety of JC Penney’s store properties and distribution centers.
CPT is a liquidating trust tasked with selling off all 146 remaining properties within three years and
distributing monthly net rents received until then. These properties are on an 18-year triple net
master lease to New JC Penney. The reorganized JC Penney is well-financed and profitable.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

CPT’s market capitalization is $956 million. The trust has a small cash balance and zero debt. Gross
annual rents from JC Penney are $111 million. After the cost of management fees and sales effort-
related expenses, the trust distributes nearly $100 million to holders annually. This 10%+ yield is
simply too high for a geographically diversified collection of commercial properties on long-term
triple net lease to a good quality tenant. Today trust units are changing hands at around $12.75.
Ultimately, I expect us to receive liquidation proceeds of $18 or more within three years, plus $1.30
per share in annualized distributions for an internal rate of return of at least 20%. The faster that
CPT winds up, the better the outcome. Know anyone who wants to buy some real estate?
Expert Market Fireworks
Since last year’s SEC rule change that effectively eliminated public quotation of non-SEC reporting
securities, we have continued to hold a select few of the affected stocks, viewing them as quasi-
permanent holdings. These are high-quality companies with competent, well-aligned management
teams. The kind of holdings you can tuck away in a portfolio for a decade or longer with full
confidence that the value of your investment is growing at an attractive rate. I know we won’t
often hear from these companies, but they
will occasionally surprise us with positive
developments. It’s an exciting day when an TABLE III: World Allocation, 6/30/22 (%)

Eurozone 15.6
This month’s entertainment came in the form Poland 7.7

earning $80 per share in operating profit. The Singapore 1.0
balance sheet couldn’t be stronger with $250
Other 0.8
per share in net cash and at least $100 per
share in non-core real estate it is preparing Total 100%
for sale. Shares most recently changed hands
at $610. Boston Sand & Gravel will have ups and downs, but its strategic location within the city
limits of Boston ensures it will enjoy steady demand for its products for decades to come. If sold,
Boston Sand & Gravel would fetch at least $1,800 per share. It won’t be sold any time soon. But
even families adamantly against selling sometimes change course when a generational transition
happens or a seller simply makes a generous offer. That’s what happened with Ash Grove Cement
a few years back. Until then, we will enjoy a growing stream of dividends and a more and more
profitable and valuable Boston Sand & Gravel under the experienced leadership of the Boylan
family.
Another Alluvial Fund expert market holding making waves is Cuisine Solutions, an innovator in
food technology. Unlike a lot of “innovators,” Cuisine Solutions manages to be highly profitable
while dedicating millions to research and development. The company has spent the last few
years constructing new state of the art facilities to produce its sous vide items for sale at Costco
and Starbucks, and for use by several airlines and restaurant chains. Turns out it wasn’t just a
few eccentric investors who noticed. In June, Bain Capital stepped up to invest $250 million in
convertible preferred stock, valuing Cuisine Solutions at over $1 billion. Bain’s investment provides
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

ample capital for expansion and sets the company on a path to an IPO and exchange listing
in a few years. To my amazement, we have been able to acquire quite a few additional Cuisine
Solutions shares since the announcement at prices 60% below the conversion price of Bain’s
investment. I expect to Cuisine Solutions to reward us richly in the coming years. Until then, if you
see their products somewhere, give them a try! You won’t be disappointed.

Letter to Limited Partners Second Quarter 2024

The diagram on the cover shows the components of a turbocharger unit for an
internal combustion engine. Ambient air is drawn into the unit, compressed,
and discharged into the engine cylinders. This denser air allows the engine to
draw an increased mass flow of air, increasing the fuel flow rate, which leads to
greater power production and performance. The exhaust from the engine is
then directed through the turbine and used to power the compressor.
Alluvial Fund portfolio company Garrett Motion produces turbochargers for
light and commercial vehicles, motorsports, and other industrial applications.
Garrett Motion’s dominant market position allows it to earn strong returns on
capital and return excess cash flow to shareholders. The company is investing
heavily in both enhanced turbocharger technologies and new technologies for
the growing hybrid and electric vehicle markets.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund had a good quarter, rising 3.9% and bringing our year-to-date gains to 10.4%.
Meanwhile, comparable benchmarks sputtered. The Russell Micro-Cap Index declined 5.3%, falling
into negative territory for 2024, while the Russell 2000 Index fell 3.3%, dragging down year-to-date
returns to just 1.7%.

A lot of ink has been spilled discussing the lamentable performance of small-cap stocks versus
their large-cap and mega-cap peers in recent years. Even after this month’s rally in small-cap
stocks, small-caps as an asset class have delivered total returns nearly 50% behind those of the
S&P 500 over the last 5 years. Instead of rehashing a tired subject, I would simply point out that
this is hardly the first time small-caps have experienced a tough stretch. Between 1995 and 1999,
large-cap stocks crushed small-caps, returning a scorching 221% to small-caps’ 116%. Then, things
changed. From 2000 to 2004, small-caps rose 38% while large-caps fell 18%. I am not making a
prediction about when small-caps and micro-caps will again produce sustained outperformance.
I am noting that in 1999, the idea of selling large-cap champions that had tripled their owners’
wealth in 5 years and buying small-cap laggards must have sounded like financial malpractice.
But those who did saw their wealth grow while large-cap stocks went nowhere for 7 years. When
the wonderful returns produced by an asset class or a market sector lead the mass of investors
to exclaim with one voice “Why invest in anything else?”, the shrewd investor will question this
consensus.
Portfolio Updates
Our portfolio is largely unchanged from last quarter with Net Lease Office Properties still at the
top. “NLOP” has been very active, selling five properties and surrendering two more to lenders
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

in May and June. NLOP used its sales proceeds to reduce its term loan by $138 million and its
mezzanine debt by $22 million. Since going public by spin-off last November, Net Lease Office
Properties has reduced its term loan and mezzanine debt by 47% to $243 million, leaving it
modestly levered and highly cash-generating as it continues to wind down.
Excluding a few properties likely to be surrendered to lenders, Net Lease Office Properties now
produces annualized base rents of $105 million. The market is valuing NLOP at $587 million for a
cap rate (net property operating income/enterprise value) of 17.9% and $90 per square foot. It’s
just plain dirt cheap, and the continuing liquidation of the Net Lease Office Properties portfolio will
cause this discount to close sooner rather than later. At a still conservative 12% cap rate or $135
per square foot, NLOP would be worth $46 per share.
In my last letter, I introduced McBride Plc, a UK-based manufacturer of private label soaps and
detergents for supermarkets and discounters. McBride is a turnaround story well into its recovery
from losses caused by inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. McBride shares have
performed well for us, up about 30% from the level of our initial purchases. In April, the company
increased its guidance for the year ending
June 30, saying adjusted operating profit
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 6/30/24 (%)
would be 10% ahead of market expectations
Net Lease Office Properties 9.3
and that net debt would continue to decline.
This week, the company confirmed it had McBride plc. 8.0
achieved this guidance, producing adjusted
Fitlife Brands Inc. 7.5
operating income of £66.4 million and
bringing net debt down to £131.5 million, MRC Global Inc. 4.4
a reduction of £30 million since last June.
ECIP Bank Basket 4.2
Shareholders were modestly disappointed
that the company did not again raise its Scandic Hotels Group AB 3.6
guidance and sent shares down 10%.
Crawford United Corp. 3.6
This is a major buying opportunity. At present, Garrett Motion Inc. 3.5
McBride has a market capitalization of £227
Rand Worldwide Inc. 3.4
million and an enterprise value of £359
million, just 5.4x trailing operating income Unidata S.p.A. 3.3
and 4.4x EBITDA. The company will continue
Total, Top Ten 50.9%
to generate significant cash flow, causing
net debt to decline and allowing McBride to
resume paying dividends. The benefits of the cost-cutting measures that McBride undertook to
restore profitability are not yet fully reflected in the company’s earnings, and sales volumes should
remain strong as European consumers turn to store brands to economize.
Talen Energy has had quite a year, selling off non-core power generation assets, buying back huge
quantities of stock, and now listing on the NASDAQ. Talen is one of those too-rare cases where
everything goes according to plan. The company is now enjoying a moment in the sun thanks
to its ownership of a top-tier producer of reliable, low-carbon energy, the Susquehanna Steam
Electric Station. So, what’s next? Talen will continue to sell off its legacy fossil fuel-burning power
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4
generation fleet and return excess capital to shareholders through buybacks. I still think the end
game for Talen is a sale of the company once its less attractive assets are divested. Susquehanna,
the nation’s sixth-largest nuclear facility with 2.5 gigawatts of power production capacity, is just too
much of a prize to be held by a company of Talen’s size.
Our collection of various banks, mainly ECIP recipients, is quietly having a good year. 2023 was
marked by endless handwringing over regional bank balance sheets and worries about fleeing
depositors. But community banks really are a different kind of animal, and it was business as
usual for our holdings. Our most successful bank investment has been United Bancorporation
of Alabama, up 19% this year and 70% from
our average cost. The Bank has excelled

Seneca Foods keeps plodding along in Other 2.3
extremely boring fashion, fitting for a canned
Total 100%
vegetable company. The company will
benefit from some struggling, over-indebted
competitors choosing to close production facilities and exit lower-margin business lines. Seneca,
with its huge base of wholly owned facilities and can production lines, is less exposed to the
inflationary pressures that have hurt competitors. Fiscal 2024 was a very profitable year for Seneca,
but not without negatives. Heavy discounting by competitors weighed on pricing and volumes,
and inventory levels stayed stubbornly high thanks to the lower volume and a large “pack” due
to a very successful growing season. But there are encouraging signs. Competitor discounting has
abated, and the company plans to process a lot fewer beans, carrots, corn, and the like in fiscal
2025. Combined with the end of a period of high capital expenditures, Seneca is set to produce a
lot of free cash flow soon. I encourage anyone to read Seneca Foods CEO Paul Palmby’s letter to
shareholders in the 2024 annual report.
Continuing the theme of “boring, profitable, and cheap,” Supremex continues to perform well.
Unfortunately, its shares have yet to respond in kind. First quarter revenues and earnings showed
improvement over the fourth quarter, with earnings rising to 14 cents per share. Management
expressed optimism that the worst of the inventory cycle slump is over but cautioned investors not
to expect a swift return to the record earnings of 2022. As it stands, Supremex is trading at only
around 7x trough earnings and at a mid-teens free cash flow yield. Any further improvement in the
demand picture could create a large upswing in profits. Management seems to believe the shares
are undervalued. Supremex is repurchasing shares to the tune of 0.4%-0.6% of outstanding shares
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

monthly, gobbling up 144,300 shares in May and another 98,100 in June.
Our only substantial sale in the quarter was our entire holding in Harbor Diversified. Harbor was
a special situation, a somewhat secretive holding company with substantial net cash and securities
and ownership of airline Air Wisconsin, which flies regional routes for American Airlines. My thesis
for owning Harbor Diversified was based on the company trading at a large discount to the value
of its net cash and securities, its legal claim against former partner United Airlines, and its fleet of
64 Bombardier CRJ-200 jets. The CRJ-200 is an admittedly aging, uncomfortable, and inefficient
aircraft that nevertheless retains some value. In 2022 and 2023, Harbor Diversified bought back
a substantial portion of shares outstanding at a discount to net asset value as it awaited the
outcome of its claim against United Airlines,
which would have amounted to roughly $1
per share. I believed that after a positive TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 6/30/24 (%)

Alluvial Fund’s assets are now hovering around $60 million. As I mentioned in the last letter, the
fund is now closed to new limited partners, but will continue to accept capital from existing limited
partners. I continue to have a lot more investment ideas than the fund has capital, which is exactly
the problem I want to have. Far better than the alternative.
In my last letter, I announced a new fund in the works. This fund will be extremely long-term
oriented and dedicated entirely to investing in securities deriving their value from unique and
irreplaceable tangible assets. I am happy to announce the fund has a name, “Tactile Fund,” and
that we are putting the finishing touches on the launch. All that remains is to create the legal
documents and establish the necessary service provider relationships. I look forward to sharing
more details soon. We will host a call for current Alluvial limited partners and clients before rolling
the fund out to the public. Please reach out if you are interested in learning more.

Letter to Limited Partners Second Quarter 2024

The diagram on the cover shows the components of a turbocharger unit for an
internal combustion engine. Ambient air is drawn into the unit, compressed,
and discharged into the engine cylinders. This denser air allows the engine to
draw an increased mass flow of air, increasing the fuel flow rate, which leads to
greater power production and performance. The exhaust from the engine is
then directed through the turbine and used to power the compressor.
Alluvial Fund portfolio company Garrett Motion produces turbochargers for
light and commercial vehicles, motorsports, and other industrial applications.
Garrett Motion’s dominant market position allows it to earn strong returns on
capital and return excess cash flow to shareholders. The company is investing
heavily in both enhanced turbocharger technologies and new technologies for
the growing hybrid and electric vehicle markets.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund had a good quarter, rising 3.9% and bringing our year-to-date gains to 10.4%.
Meanwhile, comparable benchmarks sputtered. The Russell Micro-Cap Index declined 5.3%, falling
into negative territory for 2024, while the Russell 2000 Index fell 3.3%, dragging down year-to-date
returns to just 1.7%.

A lot of ink has been spilled discussing the lamentable performance of small-cap stocks versus
their large-cap and mega-cap peers in recent years. Even after this month’s rally in small-cap
stocks, small-caps as an asset class have delivered total returns nearly 50% behind those of the
S&P 500 over the last 5 years. Instead of rehashing a tired subject, I would simply point out that
this is hardly the first time small-caps have experienced a tough stretch. Between 1995 and 1999,
large-cap stocks crushed small-caps, returning a scorching 221% to small-caps’ 116%. Then, things
changed. From 2000 to 2004, small-caps rose 38% while large-caps fell 18%. I am not making a
prediction about when small-caps and micro-caps will again produce sustained outperformance.
I am noting that in 1999, the idea of selling large-cap champions that had tripled their owners’
wealth in 5 years and buying small-cap laggards must have sounded like financial malpractice.
But those who did saw their wealth grow while large-cap stocks went nowhere for 7 years. When
the wonderful returns produced by an asset class or a market sector lead the mass of investors
to exclaim with one voice “Why invest in anything else?”, the shrewd investor will question this
consensus.
Portfolio Updates
Our portfolio is largely unchanged from last quarter with Net Lease Office Properties still at the
top. “NLOP” has been very active, selling five properties and surrendering two more to lenders
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

in May and June. NLOP used its sales proceeds to reduce its term loan by $138 million and its
mezzanine debt by $22 million. Since going public by spin-off last November, Net Lease Office
Properties has reduced its term loan and mezzanine debt by 47% to $243 million, leaving it
modestly levered and highly cash-generating as it continues to wind down.
Excluding a few properties likely to be surrendered to lenders, Net Lease Office Properties now
produces annualized base rents of $105 million. The market is valuing NLOP at $587 million for a
cap rate (net property operating income/enterprise value) of 17.9% and $90 per square foot. It’s
just plain dirt cheap, and the continuing liquidation of the Net Lease Office Properties portfolio will
cause this discount to close sooner rather than later. At a still conservative 12% cap rate or $135
per square foot, NLOP would be worth $46 per share.
In my last letter, I introduced McBride Plc, a UK-based manufacturer of private label soaps and
detergents for supermarkets and discounters. McBride is a turnaround story well into its recovery
from losses caused by inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. McBride shares have
performed well for us, up about 30% from the level of our initial purchases. In April, the company
increased its guidance for the year ending
June 30, saying adjusted operating profit
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 6/30/24 (%)
would be 10% ahead of market expectations
Net Lease Office Properties 9.3
and that net debt would continue to decline.
This week, the company confirmed it had McBride plc. 8.0
achieved this guidance, producing adjusted
Fitlife Brands Inc. 7.5
operating income of £66.4 million and
bringing net debt down to £131.5 million, MRC Global Inc. 4.4
a reduction of £30 million since last June.
ECIP Bank Basket 4.2
Shareholders were modestly disappointed
that the company did not again raise its Scandic Hotels Group AB 3.6
guidance and sent shares down 10%.

This is a major buying opportunity. At present, Garrett Motion Inc. 3.5
McBride has a market capitalization of £227
Rand Worldwide Inc. 3.4
million and an enterprise value of £359
million, just 5.4x trailing operating income Unidata S.p.A. 3.3
and 4.4x EBITDA. The company will continue
Total, Top Ten 50.9%
to generate significant cash flow, causing
net debt to decline and allowing McBride to
resume paying dividends. The benefits of the cost-cutting measures that McBride undertook to
restore profitability are not yet fully reflected in the company’s earnings, and sales volumes should
remain strong as European consumers turn to store brands to economize.
Talen Energy has had quite a year, selling off non-core power generation assets, buying back huge
quantities of stock, and now listing on the NASDAQ. Talen is one of those too-rare cases where
everything goes according to plan. The company is now enjoying a moment in the sun thanks
to its ownership of a top-tier producer of reliable, low-carbon energy, the Susquehanna Steam
Electric Station. So, what’s next? Talen will continue to sell off its legacy fossil fuel-burning power
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

generation fleet and return excess capital to shareholders through buybacks. I still think the end
game for Talen is a sale of the company once its less attractive assets are divested. Susquehanna,
the nation’s sixth-largest nuclear facility with 2.5 gigawatts of power production capacity, is just too
much of a prize to be held by a company of Talen’s size.
Our collection of various banks, mainly ECIP recipients, is quietly having a good year. 2023 was
marked by endless handwringing over regional bank balance sheets and worries about fleeing
depositors. But community banks really are a different kind of animal, and it was business as
usual for our holdings. Our most successful bank investment has been United Bancorporation
of Alabama, up 19% this year and 70% from
our average cost. The Bank has excelled

extremely boring fashion, fitting for a canned
Total 100%
vegetable company. The company will
benefit from some struggling, over-indebted
competitors choosing to close production facilities and exit lower-margin business lines. Seneca,
with its huge base of wholly owned facilities and can production lines, is less exposed to the
inflationary pressures that have hurt competitors. Fiscal 2024 was a very profitable year for Seneca,
but not without negatives. Heavy discounting by competitors weighed on pricing and volumes,
and inventory levels stayed stubbornly high thanks to the lower volume and a large “pack” due
to a very successful growing season. But there are encouraging signs. Competitor discounting has
abated, and the company plans to process a lot fewer beans, carrots, corn, and the like in fiscal
2025. Combined with the end of a period of high capital expenditures, Seneca is set to produce a
lot of free cash flow soon. I encourage anyone to read Seneca Foods CEO Paul Palmby’s letter to
shareholders in the 2024 annual report.
Continuing the theme of “boring, profitable, and cheap,” Supremex continues to perform well.
Unfortunately, its shares have yet to respond in kind. First quarter revenues and earnings showed
improvement over the fourth quarter, with earnings rising to 14 cents per share. Management
expressed optimism that the worst of the inventory cycle slump is over but cautioned investors not
to expect a swift return to the record earnings of 2022. As it stands, Supremex is trading at only
around 7x trough earnings and at a mid-teens free cash flow yield. Any further improvement in the
demand picture could create a large upswing in profits. Management seems to believe the shares
are undervalued. Supremex is repurchasing shares to the tune of 0.4%-0.6% of outstanding shares
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q2 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

monthly, gobbling up 144,300 shares in May and another 98,100 in June.
Our only substantial sale in the quarter was our entire holding in Harbor Diversified. Harbor was
a special situation, a somewhat secretive holding company with substantial net cash and securities
and ownership of airline Air Wisconsin, which flies regional routes for American Airlines. My thesis
for owning Harbor Diversified was based on the company trading at a large discount to the value
of its net cash and securities, its legal claim against former partner United Airlines, and its fleet of
64 Bombardier CRJ-200 jets. The CRJ-200 is an admittedly aging, uncomfortable, and inefficient
aircraft that nevertheless retains some value. In 2022 and 2023, Harbor Diversified bought back
a substantial portion of shares outstanding at a discount to net asset value as it awaited the
outcome of its claim against United Airlines,
which would have amounted to roughly $1
per share. I believed that after a positive TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 6/30/24 (%)
legal outcome and once Air Wisconsin’s new Consumer Staples 22.4
contract with American Airlines proved to be

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the closing price as of the previous month end.

In Q2 the NASDAQ gained 8.3% bringing its year-to-date return to 18.1%. The S&P 500 index rose 4.4% in the quarter and was up 15.2% year-to-date. The Russell 2000 and the DJIA both declined in the quarter. Cedar Creek increased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and 4.9% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,096.3%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘24 1H ‘24 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 2.5% 4.9% 1,096.3% 14.4% NASDAQ 8.3% 18.1% 665.3% 11.7% S&P 500 (SPY) 4.4% 15.2% 502.0% 10.2% DJIA (DIA) -1.7% 3.8% 443.5% 9.6% Russell 2000 -3.3% 1.7% 271.6% 7.4% Russell Microcap -5.3% -0.8% 177.2% 5.7% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,196,288 as of June 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $277,231 in the Russell MicroCap and $765,313 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 10.9 times. Weighted price-to-book was 1.7. Dividend yield was 1.6%. Weighted expected return on equity as of March 31, 2024, was 21.4%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 4%. We made the decision to completely exit our position in M&F Bancorp (MFBP). It was a difficult decision as it has immense potential if run properly or sold. The trouble is we have no confidence in the board or management to do either. In addition, the bank’s performance has been declining in recent quarters and we expect that to continue. To make matters worse, they will start paying $400,000 per quarter in preferred dividends on the ECIP funds they received nearly two years ago. We forecast Q3 earnings at around $0.20 per share. We couldn’t justify owning a bank at 15 times earnings that is being run poorly. We added to a few existing positions in the quarter and began two new positions, one is essentially a private company although it does still have a CUSIP. The second new position was Leon’s Furniture (LNF.TO or LEFUF) that we subsequently exited to build a position in something even more attractive. Leon’s is a Canadian furniture retailer that has significant land holdings in Toronto which it plans to unlock in the next couple of years. We expect to talk about what we subsequently purchased in a future letter because we are not done building our position. Expert Market Exposure Four positions make up about 85% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 9% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 5.5% of the fund, First IC (FIEB) is about 3.8%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 3.5% of the fund. Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a decrease in the market price of all four of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 28% exposure to the expert market and ended at 26% of the fund. We have discussed the situation with most of the large expert market stocks in prior letters. First IC Corporation (FIEB) is a Korean run bank outside of Atlanta, Georgia. It focuses on SBA loans and has loan production offices in Seattle and Los Angeles, and branches in Carrolton, TX, Los Angeles, CA, and Palisades Park, NJ in addition to the Atlanta metroplex. It pays a $1 annual dividend. Trailing earnings are roughly $2.65 per share. Book value is $14.58 per share. Our cost basis is $6.70 per share and the most recent trade was $7.50 per share. Efficiency ratio is 43%. We believe it is conservatively worth $25 to $30 per share. We have no idea when they may sell the bank, but let’s be honest most community banks with insider ownership eventually are sold. We are quite happy to earn a 13%+ dividend yield while we wait. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in last quarter’s letter. During the second quarter the bid price rose from $4.87 to $7.96 per share. They continue to execute on their plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management. AUM reached $3 billion. Assuming 40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.27 per share, or $1.08 per share annualized. Net cash is approximately $1.73 per share, meaning the stock is trading at six times earnings net of cash. We wrote in last quarters’ letter that we think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash. That would equate to $10.35 to $12.50 per share today with that value growing $0.27 per share every quarter. Thus, by the end of the year we see fair value being $11 to $13 per share assuming the same $1.08 per share annual earnings run rate and an estimated year-end cash balance of ~$2.40 per share. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the second quarter of 2024 from $18.05 per share to $18.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fourth quarter and fiscal yearend results. Solitron benefited from a bargain purchase gain and release of its deferred tax valuation. Reported results were income of $5.7 million or $2.73 per share in the quarter. Adjusted results were operating income of $766,000 for the quarter, or $0.37 per share. PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.71 per share to $3.32 in the second quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It is an alternative to urine testing. First quarter results showed improved income despite some one-time charges. Earnings per share rose to $0.034 per share from $0.027 per share. More importantly was revenue growth excluding our top customer of 4.6% in the quarter. Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.36 to $0.33 per unit in the quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The custodian received court approval to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Six months have since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices for the net profits interest. We have been able to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months. As of the June 28, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $37.3 million for asset retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $43.5 million. Total units outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.97 per unit have been withheld and the withheld funds amounted to $1.13 per unit after interest as of the end of April 2024. Significantly more than the quarter end $0.33 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO balances. We suspect the operator would try to argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the operator when they purchased the properties, and the operator transferred it to the trust at its creation, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it. Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flow that the net profits interest would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production has resulted in approximately $10.7 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges the trust about $1.3 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the net profits interest was sold, leaving trailing twelve-month pre-tax cash flow of $9.4 million. The unknown is what multiple of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of June was $12.7 million, or about fifteen months’ worth of cash flows. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price declined from $49.60 per share at the end of the first quarter to $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter. Citizens issued a press release which they normally do not do. Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 were $1.95 per share, an increase of 16% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. In the first quarter they paid a $1.00 annual dividend. Earnings run rate is roughly $8 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at six times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
It sounds like a broken record – the market continued to be led by a small handful of tech
companies propelling the NASDAQ and S&P 500 ahead of the other major indices we track.
In Q2 the NASDAQ gained 8.3% bringing its year-to-date return to 18.1%. The S&P 500
index rose 4.4% in the quarter and was up 15.2% year-to-date. The Russell 2000 and the
DJIA both declined in the quarter. Cedar Creek increased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and
4.9% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,096.3%, net of fees and expenses.
Q2 ‘24 1H ‘24 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.5% 4.9% 1,096.3% 14.4%
NASDAQ 8.3% 18.1% 665.3% 11.7%
S&P 500 (SPY) 4.4% 15.2% 502.0% 10.2%
DJIA (DIA) -1.7% 3.8% 443.5% 9.6%
Russell 2000 -3.3% 1.7% 271.6% 7.4%
Russell Microcap -5.3% -0.8% 177.2% 5.7%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,196,288
as of June 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we
compare against would have only grown to between $277,231 in the Russell MicroCap and
$765,313 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.9 times.
Weighted price-to-book was 1.7. Dividend yield was 1.6%. Weighted expected return on
equity as of March 31, 2024, was 21.4%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 4%. We made the
decision to completely exit our position in M&F Bancorp (MFBP). It was a difficult decision
as it has immense potential if run properly or sold. The trouble is we have no confidence in
the board or management to do either. In addition, the bank’s performance has been
declining in recent quarters and we expect that to continue. To make matters worse, they
will start paying $400,000 per quarter in preferred dividends on the ECIP funds they received
nearly two years ago. We forecast Q3 earnings at around $0.20 per share. We couldn’t
justify owning a bank at 15 times earnings that is being run poorly.
We added to a few existing positions in the quarter and began two new positions, one is
essentially a private company although it does still have a CUSIP. The second new position
was Leon’s Furniture (LNF.TO or LEFUF) that we subsequently exited to build a position in
something even more attractive. Leon’s is a Canadian furniture retailer that has significant
land holdings in Toronto which it plans to unlock in the next couple of years. We expect to
talk about what we subsequently purchased in a future letter because we are not done
building our position.
Expert Market Exposure
Four positions make up about 85% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 9% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 5.5% of the fund, First
IC (FIEB) is about 3.8%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 3.5% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all four of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 28% exposure to the expert market and ended at
26% of the fund.
We have discussed the situation with most of the large expert market stocks in prior letters.
First IC Corporation (FIEB) is a Korean run bank outside of Atlanta, Georgia. It focuses on
SBA loans and has loan production offices in Seattle and Los Angeles, and branches in
Carrolton, TX, Los Angeles, CA, and Palisades Park, NJ in addition to the Atlanta metroplex.
It pays a $1 annual dividend. Trailing earnings are roughly $2.65 per share. Book value is
$14.58 per share. Our cost basis is $6.70 per share and the most recent trade was $7.50
per share. Efficiency ratio is 43%. We believe it is conservatively worth $25 to $30 per
share. We have no idea when they may sell the bank, but let’s be honest most community
banks with insider ownership eventually are sold. We are quite happy to earn a 13%+
dividend yield while we wait.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in last quarter’s letter. During the second quarter the bid
price rose from $4.87 to $7.96 per share. They continue to execute on their plans. They
announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management. AUM reached $3 billion. Assuming
40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.27 per
share, or $1.08 per share annualized. Net cash is approximately $1.73 per share, meaning
the stock is trading at six times earnings net of cash.
We wrote in last quarters’ letter that we think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times
current earnings plus net cash. That would equate to $10.35 to $12.50 per share today with
that value growing $0.27 per share every quarter. Thus, by the end of the year we see fair
value being $11 to $13 per share assuming the same $1.08 per share annual earnings run
rate and an estimated year-end cash balance of ~$2.40 per share.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the second quarter
of 2024 from $18.05 per share to $18.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fourth quarter and fiscal yearend
results. Solitron benefited from a bargain purchase gain and release of its deferred tax
valuation. Reported results were income of $5.7 million or $2.73 per share in the quarter.
Adjusted results were operating income of $766,000 for the quarter, or $0.37 per share.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.71 per share to $3.32
in the second quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It
is an alternative to urine testing. First quarter results showed improved income despite some
one-time charges. Earnings per share rose to $0.034 per share from $0.027 per share. More
importantly was revenue growth excluding our top customer of 4.6% in the quarter.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.36 to $0.33 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The custodian received court approval to
delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Six months have since passed,
and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster
repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a
worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices

for the net profits interest. We have been able to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the
past few months.
As of the June 28, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $37.3 million for asset
retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate
of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $43.5 million. Total units
outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.97 per unit have been withheld and the withheld
funds amounted to $1.13 per unit after interest as of the end of April 2024. Significantly
more than the quarter end $0.33 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try to argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and the operator (allegedly) transferred it to
the trust at its creation3, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flow that the net
profits interest would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not
assessed until incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in
the production has resulted in approximately $10.7 million of distributable proceeds. The
operator charges the trust about $1.3 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated
if the net profits interest was sold, leaving trailing twelve-month pre-tax cash flow of $9.4
million. The unknown is what multiple of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market
cap at the end of June was $12.7 million, or about fifteen months’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price declined from $49.60 per share at the end of the first
quarter to $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter. Citizens issued a press release
which they normally do not do. Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 were $1.95 per share,
an increase of 16% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by
10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. In the first quarter
they paid a $1.00 annual dividend. Earnings run rate is roughly $8 per share. The stock is
an incredible bargain at six times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is
shareholder friendly.
Tax Information and K-1’s
Investor K-1’s were issued on April 4. The fund’s annual audit report was sent electronically
on April 27 and again on May 4 due to email issues. If any of the fund’s investors did not
receive either, please contact us.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.
3 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019, seven years later.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

They continue to execute on their plans. They announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management. AUM reached $3 billion. Assuming 40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.27 per share, or $1.08 per share annualized. Net cash is approximately $1.73 per share, meaning the stock is trading at six times earnings net of cash. We wrote in last quarters’ letter that we think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times current earnings plus net cash. That would equate to $10.35 to $12.50 per share today with that value growing $0.27 per share every quarter. Thus, by the end of the year we see fair value being $11 to $13 per share assuming the same $1.08 per share annual earnings run rate and an estimated year-end cash balance of ~$2.40 per share. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the second quarter of 2024 from $18.05 per share to $18.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fourth quarter and fiscal yearend results. Solitron benefited from a bargain purchase gain and release of its deferred tax valuation.

As you may recall the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis. We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus to receive while we wait. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.36 to $0.33 per unit in the quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The custodian received court approval to delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Six months have since passed, and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster repayment of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assessed by the operator, PCEC. In a worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices for the net profits interest. We have been able to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the past few months. As of the June 28, 2024, production update, the operator has withheld $37.3 million for asset retirement obligations. If the withheld funds are credited with interest at the discount rate of 7.36% used in the ARO calculations, it puts a total value of $43.5 million. Total units outstanding are 38.58 million. Thus $0.97 per unit have been withheld and the withheld funds amounted to $1.13 per unit after interest as of the end of April 2024. Significantly more than the quarter end $0.33 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO balances. We suspect the operator would try to argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the operator when they purchased the properties, and the operator transferred it to the trust at its creation, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it. Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flow that the net profits interest would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not assessed until incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in the production has resulted in approximately $10.7 million of distributable proceeds. The operator charges the trust about $1.3 million annually. Trust expenses would be eliminated if the net profits interest was sold, leaving trailing twelve-month pre-tax cash flow of $9.4 million. The unknown is what multiple of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market cap at the end of June was $12.7 million, or about fifteen months’ worth of cash flows. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. The bid price declined from $49.60 per share at the end of the first quarter to $45.45 per share at the end of the second quarter. Citizens issued a press release which they normally do not do. Earnings for the first quarter of 2024 were $1.95 per share, an increase of 16% versus the prior year quarter. They have reduced their share count by 10% over the last year, from 2.0 million shares to 1.8 million shares. In the first quarter they paid a $1.00 annual dividend. Earnings run rate is roughly $8 per share. The stock is an incredible bargain at six times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is shareholder friendly.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2024 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
It sounds like a broken record – the market continued to be led by a small handful of tech
companies propelling the NASDAQ and S&P 500 ahead of the other major indices we track.
In Q2 the NASDAQ gained 8.3% bringing its year-to-date return to 18.1%. The S&P 500
index rose 4.4% in the quarter and was up 15.2% year-to-date. The Russell 2000 and the
DJIA both declined in the quarter. Cedar Creek increased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and
4.9% year-to-date, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18+ year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,096.3%, net of fees and expenses.
Q2 ‘24 1H ‘24 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.5% 4.9% 1,096.3% 14.4%
NASDAQ 8.3% 18.1% 665.3% 11.7%
S&P 500 (SPY) 4.4% 15.2% 502.0% 10.2%
DJIA (DIA) -1.7% 3.8% 443.5% 9.6%
Russell 2000 -3.3% 1.7% 271.6% 7.4%
Russell Microcap -5.3% -0.8% 177.2% 5.7%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,196,288
as of June 30, 2024, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we
compare against would have only grown to between $277,231 in the Russell MicroCap and
$765,313 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2024, the fund’s holdings were trading at 8
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.5 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 10.9 times.
Weighted price-to-book was 1.7. Dividend yield was 1.6%. Weighted expected return on
equity as of March 31, 2024, was 21.4%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 3% and ended the quarter at 4%. We made the
decision to completely exit our position in M&F Bancorp (MFBP). It was a difficult decision
as it has immense potential if run properly or sold. The trouble is we have no confidence in
the board or management to do either. In addition, the bank’s performance has been
declining in recent quarters and we expect that to continue. To make matters worse, they
will start paying $400,000 per quarter in preferred dividends on the ECIP funds they received
nearly two years ago. We forecast Q3 earnings at around $0.20 per share. We couldn’t
justify owning a bank at 15 times earnings that is being run poorly.
We added to a few existing positions in the quarter and began two new positions, one is
essentially a private company although it does still have a CUSIP. The second new position
was Leon’s Furniture (LNF.TO or LEFUF) that we subsequently exited to build a position in
something even more attractive. Leon’s is a Canadian furniture retailer that has significant
land holdings in Toronto which it plans to unlock in the next couple of years. We expect to
talk about what we subsequently purchased in a future letter because we are not done
building our position.
Expert Market Exposure
Four positions make up about 85% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 9% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 5.5% of the fund, First
IC (FIEB) is about 3.8%, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 3.5% of the fund.
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter due to a
decrease in the market price of all four of our largest holdings. Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying
restriction. We started the quarter with 28% exposure to the expert market and ended at
26% of the fund.
We have discussed the situation with most of the large expert market stocks in prior letters.
First IC Corporation (FIEB) is a Korean run bank outside of Atlanta, Georgia. It focuses on
SBA loans and has loan production offices in Seattle and Los Angeles, and branches in
Carrolton, TX, Los Angeles, CA, and Palisades Park, NJ in addition to the Atlanta metroplex.
It pays a $1 annual dividend. Trailing earnings are roughly $2.65 per share. Book value is
$14.58 per share. Our cost basis is $6.70 per share and the most recent trade was $7.50
per share. Efficiency ratio is 43%. We believe it is conservatively worth $25 to $30 per
share. We have no idea when they may sell the bank, but let’s be honest most community
banks with insider ownership eventually are sold. We are quite happy to earn a 13%+
dividend yield while we wait.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. Due to
the uncertainty of the situation, we did not attribute any earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).

Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
ENDI Corp (ENDI) – we profiled in last quarter’s letter. During the second quarter the bid
price rose from $4.87 to $7.96 per share. They continue to execute on their plans. They
announced the sale of Willow Oak Asset Management. AUM reached $3 billion. Assuming
40% cash operating margins, quarterly cash earnings should be approximately $0.27 per
share, or $1.08 per share annualized. Net cash is approximately $1.73 per share, meaning
the stock is trading at six times earnings net of cash.
We wrote in last quarters’ letter that we think shares of ENDI are worth eight to ten times
current earnings plus net cash. That would equate to $10.35 to $12.50 per share today with
that value growing $0.27 per share every quarter. Thus, by the end of the year we see fair
value being $11 to $13 per share assuming the same $1.08 per share annual earnings run
rate and an estimated year-end cash balance of ~$2.40 per share.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased slightly in the second quarter
of 2024 from $18.05 per share to $18.00 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. Subsequent to quarter end, Solitron announced fourth quarter and fiscal yearend
results. Solitron benefited from a bargain purchase gain and release of its deferred tax
valuation. Reported results were income of $5.7 million or $2.73 per share in the quarter.
Adjusted results were operating income of $766,000 for the quarter, or $0.37 per share.
PharmChem (PCHM) – the fund is the largest owner, at 33% of outstanding shares, and I
serve as Chairman of the Board. The bid price for shares rose from $2.71 per share to $3.32
in the second quarter. PharmChem makes sweat patches used to detect drugs of abuse. It
is an alternative to urine testing. First quarter results showed improved income despite some
one-time charges. Earnings per share rose to $0.034 per share from $0.027 per share. More
importantly was revenue growth excluding our top customer of 4.6% in the quarter.
Propel Media (PROM) – in January the acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) was blocked by
the FTC and both Propel and IQVIA decided to walk away rather than fight. As you may recall
the deal was reportedly for between $700 and $800 million, or $2.75 to $3.15 per Propel
share. We were able to purchase shares for $0.23 per share after becoming aware of the
deal in published reports. Propel declared two dividends prior to the deal being called off and
paid an additional dividend in February 2024 and announced one for May. All told the
dividends amount to $0.0352 per share, or over 15% on our cost basis.
We purchased the stock in hopes of the deal going through. We had the possibility of 10-12x
return. We knew that if it didn’t happen, we were still likely getting a bargain. We doubted
that the next best liquidity event would value the company at 1/10 of the potential merger
price with IQVIA. We still believe that and are willing to wait. The dividends are a nice bonus
to receive while we wait (see our 2023 Q2, Q3 and yearend letters for more details on our
thoughts).
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.36 to $0.33 per unit in the
quarter. Not much new happened in the quarter. The custodian received court approval to
delay liquidation until completion of the audits for 2019-2023. Six months have since passed,
and no progress has been announced on any of the audits for those years.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them for four years. BNY Mellon has not communicated what is causing
the delay. The recent increase in oil prices is also a positive event. It allows for faster

worst-case scenario of dissolution and sale, higher oil prices should result in higher bid prices

for the net profits interest. We have been able to add to our position at $0.30 per unit in the
past few months.

more than the quarter end $0.33 unit price. If the trust is dissolved and the net profits
interest sold, it is still our argument that the ARO liability transfers to the buyer, thus
unitholders should be credited the withheld ARO funds less legal costs incurred by the trust
and operator but should not be assessed any interest charges on current or past ARO
balances. We suspect the operator would try to argue that the ARO doesn’t transfer to the
buyer, which would be amazingly hypocritical in our opinion, since it transferred to the
operator when they purchased the properties, and the operator (allegedly) transferred it to
the trust at its creation3, but nevertheless we suspect they would still argue it.
Another way to look at the investment is to calculate the amount of cash flow that the net
profits interest would generate to the potential buyer assuming ARO is not transferred or not
assessed until incurred. Over the last twelve months, the trust’s 80% net profits interest in
the production has resulted in approximately $10.7 million of distributable proceeds. The

million. The unknown is what multiple of cash flow bidders will be willing to pay. The market
cap at the end of June was $12.7 million, or about fifteen months’ worth of cash flows.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. The bid price declined from $49.60 per share at the end of the first

an incredible bargain at six times earnings for a massively overcapitalized bank that is

Tax Information and K-1’s
Investor K-1’s were issued on April 4. The fund’s annual audit report was sent electronically

Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.
3 We say allegedly because the offering documents in the 2012 IPO all show the ARO as remaining with the
operator. It was only assessed to the trust after new owners took over in 2019, seven years later.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2024 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

Dear Partners,
For the first quarter of 2022, Alluvial Fund fell 7.3%, slightly better than relevant benchmarks.
Coming off an excellent year, the market’s mood has taken a turn for the dour. And why not? The
wind has come out of tech stocks, US consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation despite excellent
employment trends, interest rates are on the rise, and Europe has been rocked by Putin’s brutal
and indefensible invasion of Ukraine. Bad news is not hard to find. However, investor pessimism
is what winds up creating opportunities. Inevitably, some high-quality businesses will be sold
indiscriminately by fearful investors, and attractive special situations will develop while investors
are obsessing over the latest CPI print or jobs report. Alluvial Fund is full of just such opportunities,
and I spend every day looking for more.

Alluvial Fund’s largest holding, P10 Inc., was a drag on performance this quarter. P10 fell 13% in
the first quarter and is down 16% this year as I write. I have laid out the case for P10 multiple times
over the years we have owned it, so I won’t bore you once again with the intricacies. Suffice to say
nothing has changed. P10 continues to possess supremely stable and predictable cash flows that
will grow organically with zero associated capital expenditures. The company will use these cash
flows to acquire additional alternative assets management cash flow streams. Management owns
huge quantities of stock and is highly motivated to build the value of P10’s franchise.
P10 ended the year with $17.3 billion in fee-paying assets under management and guided toward
an additional $5 billion by year-end 2023, excluding any acquisitions the company may perform.
Existing assets under management, assuming a 58% cash margin and the company’s current debt
structure, will produce $95 million in annual cash flow or almost 80 cents per share. $5 billion in
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

incremental AUM could push that figure to $1.05 per share or more. I view 20x 2023 free cash flow,
or $21, as a very modest short-term target for P10 stock.
Clearly, I think P10’s future is as bright as ever. This drawdown doesn’t concern me in the slightest.
It has not been a fun experience, but it’s also not the first time it has happened. In fact, P10 shares
dipped more than 20% three times between January 2019 and the company’s IPO and uplisting in
late 2021.
Those declines were no sunny day at the park either, but we held on and enjoyed the rewards on
the other side. Occasional declines, even steep ones, are an unpleasant but unavoidable fact of life
that must be tolerated to enjoy the long-term compounding of high-quality companies. Imagine
selling P10 in September 2019 when the stock
CHART: P10 Drawdowns 2019-21
fell from $1.40 to $1.06, only to watch it rise to
$4 a year later. I did not make that mistake then, 0%
and I won’t make it now.

On International Investing

35% of the Alluvial Fund portfolio is invested

US markets depending on the opportunity set.
2019 2020 2021
But why? Why look internationally when the US
stock market has produced so much wealth for shareholders? Few foreign markets have produced
anywhere close to the long-term returns that investors in American stocks have enjoyed. Will that
continue? Nobody can say for sure, but there are durable advantages that the American market
enjoys. The United States, despite its flaws, is the world’s premier economy with legal structures
and institutions that encourage capital development.
But sadly, the US has done a poor job of late in encouraging small companies to become publicly
traded or remain so. The regulatory burden and financial cost of public status is onerous for small
companies. Companies too small to achieve inclusion in indexes or research coverage from sell-
side firms do not experience the cost of capital advantages that accrue to larger public companies.
As a result, the number of small public companies in the US has declined dramatically over time.
There are now only a little over 2,000 companies with market capitalizations below $300 million
trading on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Add OTC-traded companies of reasonable quality and you
get to perhaps 2,800 American micro-caps. By contrast, Sweden has 600, France nearly 500, and
Australia almost 1,600! Three countries with a combined GDP one-fifth that of the United States
manage to offer nearly the same number of small companies for investors to assess. Then there
are other major markets like Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan…the list goes on. And that’s ignoring
all the emerging and frontier economies out there. All told, foreign markets where Alluvial Fund
is active feature more than six times as many small companies as US markets. And what’s more,
certain countries have figured out how to incentivize high quality small companies to go public
using tax incentives and appropriate regulatory relief. While most small public US companies are
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

of the more speculative variety, small companies in places like Sweden, Norway, Italy, and France
are very often profitable and cash-producing with solid balance sheets and prospects. There seems
to be no appetite in the US to make the public markets friendlier for small companies. Unless that
changes, I fear that more and more small American companies will go private or never go public in
the first place.
So that’s why I look for value in foreign markets. Regardless of the performance of broad country
indexes, there will be small companies that perform brilliantly for shareholders. Mathematically, I
increase our chances of finding something special by expanding the opportunity set. Practically,
I know that every economy has intelligent, entrepreneurial people doing their best to build
something special in the public markets. I also know that from time to time, the market will fail
to understand and appreciate their efforts and I can accumulate shares at very attractive prices.
International investing has been good to Alluvial Fund, especially our forays into Sweden and Italy.
And this comes against the backdrop of lackluster European economic growth and stock market
performance. Europe has spent most of this century lurching from one economic and political crisis
to the next. If we ever arrive at a time when the phrase “investing in Europe” elicits more intrigued
looks than incredulous expressions, we could really see our foreign holdings fly. For now, I am
quite happy with the returns our foreign holdings have generated for the fund, and for the useful
diversification they provide.
Polish Stocks
In my last quarterly letter, I discussed opportunities in the Polish stock market and the fund’s
new investments there. I expressed enthusiasm over the high quality and low valuations of many
Polish companies but recognized the need to limit our allocation based on the political and
economic risks of investing in Poland. Sometimes risk arrives a lot quicker than you had hoped.
With war raging to the east, the Polish market is down 9% year-to-date and worse in US Dollar
terms. Alluvial Fund’s Polish holdings have out-performed their indexes, with our largest holding
TIM SA down 3% and our second-largest holding, Auto Partner SA, up 3%. Each company has
a robust balance sheet and a business model that should allow it to grow even if local economic
conditions worsen. Neither has seen its results affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. TIM
SA’s first quarter 2022 revenues rose 55% year-over-year, including an increase of an incredible
67% in March. The company served 19,000 customers in the month, nearly the same as it served in
the entire first quarter of 2021. For its part, Auto Partner’s first quarter revenues were up 34%. As
distributors, both companies benefit from an inflationary environment and supply chain woes. Their
customers are accelerating purchases to ensure adequate inventories and to avoid price increases.
TIM and Auto Partner are executing well, but it may be some time before the results are reflected
in their share prices. Headlines out of Moscow and Kyiv, will weigh on Polish share prices for the
foreseeable future. Nevertheless, I am confident that 2-3 years from now, shares of each will be
considerably higher than today. As much as I wish our investments would commence a steady
ascent toward fair value the minute we purchase them, markets are not always so cooperative.
However, the stumbles along the way often present opportunities to acquire more shares at very
attractive prices.

GEE Group
A newer holding for Alluvial Fund is GEE Group. GEE Group operates a simple and time-honored
business: temporary labor and recruiting. The company focuses on professional markets like
healthcare, technology, and finance/accounting. The employment agency industry isn’t the world’s
most attractive business model, but it does have a few things going for it. Most agencies require
little in the way of capital expenditure or
physical assets and their cost structure is
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 3/31/22 (%)
highly variable. Cash generation is counter-
cyclical. On the other hand, agencies do P10 Inc. 13.5
require a good deal of working capital
Unidata S.p.A. 10.8
investment and there is little differentiation
Crawford United Corp. 5.6
between firms; not a lot of value in brands, in
other words.
Rand Worldwide Inc. 5.2
Garrett Motion Inc. 5.2
Because most temp agencies are rather
similar and the industry is fragmented, roll- LICT Corporation 4.9
up strategies are viable. That is exactly the
Butler National Corp. 4.4
strategy that CEO Derek Dewan pursued
in his former role as CEO of AccuStaff/MPS GEE Group Inc. 4.2
Group, which was ultimately sold for $1.3
Harbor Diversified Inc. 4.0
billion in 2010. GEE Group was pursuing the
same strategy under Dewan’s leadership but Pegroco Invest AB 3.7
ran into trouble when COVID struck. The firm
Total, Top Ten 61.5%
had funded acquisitions with high-cost debt
and found itself at the brink of insolvency
when demand for its services vanished. In April 2021, GEE Group remedied its debt woes by
issuing a gigantic amount of equity at 60 cents per share. The capital raise was sufficient to pay off
all of GEE Group’s debt besides its PPP loans, which have since been forgiven.
Today, GEE Group is once again solidly profitable. The company has $12 million in cash and zero
debt. Despite the remarkable improvement, GEE Group shares languish below last April’s offering
price. Shares trade at just 4.2x EBITDA and with a mid-teens free cash flow yield, cheap by any
measure and less than half the valuation of similar companies. So, what gives? I think investors
have two concerns:
• Did GEE Group really learn a lesson or will it rush out to lever up once again, possibly
overpaying for acquisitions in the process? I suppose GEE Group could announce a $50
million debt-funded acquisition tomorrow, but I highly doubt it. GEE Group is aware of
the need to rebuild investor confidence. I believe GEE Group will keep its first acquisitions
on the smaller side to prove to investors it can grow in a responsible manner. GEE Group
insiders saw their holdings diluted badly in the brush with bankruptcy. They are not in a
hurry to revisit the experience.
• GEE Group clearly wants to resume acquisitions activity, but its low valuation makes
paying with stock a dilutive proposition. Can the company avoid the temptation to issue
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

stock? GEE Group management is aware of its depressed valuation and has indicated that
stock-financed acquisitions are off the table at these levels. For now, the company will
finance any acquisitions with a combination of cash on hand, bank financing, and/or seller
financing. To that end, the company closed on a $20 million borrowing facility in March.
GEE Group is not the kind of company I would pay 20 or 25 times earnings to own. It’s unlikely
that the company will have a place in our portfolio for the long term unless management proves
exceptionally adept in acquiring good quality staffing firms at good prices. But 4.2x EBITDA is
just too cheap for a decent little company with zero debt and a workable plan. The factors driving
this discounted valuation will dissipate as the company reports quarter after profitable quarter and
shares will move toward a more justifiable valuation.
Harbor Diversified
We have added a new special situation to our collection: Harbor Diversified. Harbor is a holding
company for Wisconsin Airlines. Ordinarily I have little interest in airlines of any kind, but Harbor
Diversified is a special case. At around $2.40 per share, Harbor trades at a steep discount to
liquidation value. Harbor trades so cheaply because Air Wisconsin’s capacity agreement with
United Airlines expires in February 2023 and
United has declined to renew the contract
TABLE III: World Allocation, 3/31/22 (%)
on the same terms. Air Wisconsin is in
United States 65.5
discussions with United and other airlines on
a new contract, but there is a material chance Eurozone 17.1
that a contract will not be secured and Air
Poland 8.0
Wisconsin’s fleet will be grounded come next
February. Sweden 7.1
Other 2.3
But even in the case that Air Wisconsin
fails to achieve a new contract, Harbor’s Total 100%
existing working capital, fleet, and remaining
earnings are worth well in excess of the company’s trading price. At year-end, the company had
over $2 per share in cash, securities, and interest-bearing receivables net of debt, all future lease
payments, and preferred stock liquidation preference. Air Wisconsin will produce pre-tax cash flow
of nearly $90 million over the length of its remaining contract. And then there is the fleet itself. Air
Wisconsin owns 64 Bombardier CRJ200s. These aircraft are old and the CRJ200 itself is not exactly
a popular jet, but they are worth something. At even $250,000 each, less than 15% of book value,
that’s $16 million or 25 cents per share.
I expect that over the course of the year, Harbor Diversified will either announce a new contract for
Air Wisconsin or will begin preparations for an orderly liquidation. In a liquidation scenario, shares
are worth north of $3. If a new contract is secured, their value could be substantially higher as
investors begin valuing the company as a going concern instead of a liquidation story. For its part,
Air Wisconsin seems to be optimistic about securing a new contract. The company is very active
on the hiring front, seeking pilots, flight attendants, and mechanics; not exactly the behavior of an
airline that expects to shutter permanently in 10 months.

Concluding Thoughts
While 2022 is off to a disappointing start, I have high hopes for the remainder of the year. By and
large our companies reported solid fourth quarter results, and we will soon begin receiving first
quarter earnings reports. Declining markets and increased investor anxiety have created some
promising scenarios, particularly in Europe. I have also begun building positions in a few US special
situations that offer excellent return potential with limited risk. More to come on those.
As always, I thank you for the opportunity to manage capital on your behalf. All of my family’s
investable capital is invested in Alluvial Fund. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with questions on
the Alluvial Fund portfolio or strategy. I hope you and your families are well and I look forward to
writing to you once again in a few months.

Dear Partners,
For the first quarter of 2022, Alluvial Fund fell 7.3%, slightly better than relevant benchmarks.
Coming off an excellent year, the market’s mood has taken a turn for the dour. And why not? The
wind has come out of tech stocks, US consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation despite excellent
employment trends, interest rates are on the rise, and Europe has been rocked by Putin’s brutal
and indefensible invasion of Ukraine. Bad news is not hard to find. However, investor pessimism
is what winds up creating opportunities. Inevitably, some high-quality businesses will be sold
indiscriminately by fearful investors, and attractive special situations will develop while investors
are obsessing over the latest CPI print or jobs report. Alluvial Fund is full of just such opportunities,
and I spend every day looking for more.

Alluvial Fund’s largest holding, P10 Inc., was a drag on performance this quarter. P10 fell 13% in
the first quarter and is down 16% this year as I write. I have laid out the case for P10 multiple times
over the years we have owned it, so I won’t bore you once again with the intricacies. Suffice to say
nothing has changed. P10 continues to possess supremely stable and predictable cash flows that
will grow organically with zero associated capital expenditures. The company will use these cash
flows to acquire additional alternative assets management cash flow streams. Management owns
huge quantities of stock and is highly motivated to build the value of P10’s franchise.
P10 ended the year with $17.3 billion in fee-paying assets under management and guided toward
an additional $5 billion by year-end 2023, excluding any acquisitions the company may perform.
Existing assets under management, assuming a 58% cash margin and the company’s current debt
structure, will produce $95 million in annual cash flow or almost 80 cents per share. $5 billion in
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

incremental AUM could push that figure to $1.05 per share or more. I view 20x 2023 free cash flow,
or $21, as a very modest short-term target for P10 stock.
Clearly, I think P10’s future is as bright as ever. This drawdown doesn’t concern me in the slightest.
It has not been a fun experience, but it’s also not the first time it has happened. In fact, P10 shares
dipped more than 20% three times between January 2019 and the company’s IPO and uplisting in
late 2021.
Those declines were no sunny day at the park either, but we held on and enjoyed the rewards on
the other side. Occasional declines, even steep ones, are an unpleasant but unavoidable fact of life
that must be tolerated to enjoy the long-term compounding of high-quality companies. Imagine
selling P10 in September 2019 when the stock
CHART: P10 Drawdowns 2019-21
fell from $1.40 to $1.06, only to watch it rise to
$4 a year later. I did not make that mistake then, 0%
and I won’t make it now.
-10%
On International Investing
-20%
35% of the Alluvial Fund portfolio is invested
in non-US stocks, almost entirely Western -30%
European and Scandinavian companies. I
always tell partners to expect one third of the -40%
portfolio, give or take, to be invested in non-
-50%
US markets depending on the opportunity set.
2019 2020 2021
But why? Why look internationally when the US
stock market has produced so much wealth for shareholders? Few foreign markets have produced
anywhere close to the long-term returns that investors in American stocks have enjoyed. Will that
continue? Nobody can say for sure, but there are durable advantages that the American market
enjoys. The United States, despite its flaws, is the world’s premier economy with legal structures
and institutions that encourage capital development.
But sadly, the US has done a poor job of late in encouraging small companies to become publicly
traded or remain so. The regulatory burden and financial cost of public status is onerous for small
companies. Companies too small to achieve inclusion in indexes or research coverage from sell-
side firms do not experience the cost of capital advantages that accrue to larger public companies.
As a result, the number of small public companies in the US has declined dramatically over time.
There are now only a little over 2,000 companies with market capitalizations below $300 million
trading on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Add OTC-traded companies of reasonable quality and you
get to perhaps 2,800 American micro-caps. By contrast, Sweden has 600, France nearly 500, and
Australia almost 1,600! Three countries with a combined GDP one-fifth that of the United States
manage to offer nearly the same number of small companies for investors to assess. Then there
are other major markets like Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan…the list goes on. And that’s ignoring
all the emerging and frontier economies out there. All told, foreign markets where Alluvial Fund
is active feature more than six times as many small companies as US markets. And what’s more,
certain countries have figured out how to incentivize high quality small companies to go public
using tax incentives and appropriate regulatory relief. While most small public US companies are
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

of the more speculative variety, small companies in places like Sweden, Norway, Italy, and France
are very often profitable and cash-producing with solid balance sheets and prospects. There seems
to be no appetite in the US to make the public markets friendlier for small companies. Unless that
changes, I fear that more and more small American companies will go private or never go public in
the first place.
So that’s why I look for value in foreign markets. Regardless of the performance of broad country
indexes, there will be small companies that perform brilliantly for shareholders. Mathematically, I
increase our chances of finding something special by expanding the opportunity set. Practically,
I know that every economy has intelligent, entrepreneurial people doing their best to build
something special in the public markets. I also know that from time to time, the market will fail
to understand and appreciate their efforts and I can accumulate shares at very attractive prices.
International investing has been good to Alluvial Fund, especially our forays into Sweden and Italy.
And this comes against the backdrop of lackluster European economic growth and stock market
performance. Europe has spent most of this century lurching from one economic and political crisis

The NASDAQ rose 12.8% in the quarter and was up 31.7% for the first half. The tech leaders of the NASDAQ were largely responsible for the strong performance of the S&P 500 as well. Cedar Creek decreased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and was up 3.7% for the first half of 2023, net of fees and expenses. Under performance versus the Russell 2000 and Russell Micro Cap was primarily attributable to our higher bank exposure during the quarter. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/2 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 883.9%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘23 1H ’23 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -2.5% 3.7% 883.9% 14.0% NASDAQ 12.8% 31.7% 495.1% 10.8% S&P 500 (SPY) 8.7% 16.8% 383.6% 9.4% DJIA (DIA) 3.9% 4.8% 368.2% 9.2% Russell 2000 5.2% 8.1% 237.6% 7.2% Russell Microcap 5.3% 2.3% 161.6% 5.7% $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $983,863 as of June 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $261,642 in the Russell Micro Cap and $595,066 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.0 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 7.6 times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 1.9%. Weighted expected return on equity as of June 30, 2023, was 25%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 16% and ended the quarter at 8%. We continued to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC Corp (FIEB). First IC is a community bank focused on the Korean community that was not a recipient of funds through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It trades on the expert market and was selling for about three times trailing earnings, about half of book value, and had a dividend yield of 16%. PD-Rx is also on the expert market and trades at three times trailing earnings, and just over one times earnings net of cash. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased significantly in the quarter, due to purchases noted above in PD-Rx and First IC, and due to the purchase of Propel Media (PROM) profiled below. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 27% exposure and ended at 37% of the fund. Three positions make up about 65% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX), which is about 12% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which is roughly 6.5% of the fund, and Propel Media (PROM) is about 5.5%. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link). Amazing Opportunity in the Expert Market We Have Waited For While we thought it was a stupid decision by the SEC and harmful to retail investors, our hope was that the expert market would create occasional opportunities to put capital to work at incredibly attractive prices. For the first year we were able to build positions in PD-Rx and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) which could be worth five times its current price if, as we believe, the improper assessment of asset retirement obligations to the trust is reversed by the courts. While both of those opportunities are very attractive, we had yet to come across the opportunity we were hoping for. That changed in the quarter. Propel Media (PROM) – trades on the expert market. We briefly covered it in our 2020 first quarter letter (link). At the time it had 246 million shares outstanding. It traded around $0.13 per share and earnings in 2018 were $23 million, or $0.09 per share. Earnings were being used to pay down debt. We sold the entire position at up to $0.29 in the second quarter of 2021 and explained our reasoning - we had achieved a decent gain and the business was declining – earnings had fallen to $0.04 per share in 2019 and the outlook was not positive. We felt fine about our decision as the stock rarely traded after implementation of Rule 15c2- 11 forced it onto the expert market. In fact, between January 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023 it appears only about 20,000 shares traded. Most at $0.10 per share, which the fund actually bought, and about 1,000 shares at $0.01 and an even smaller amount at $0.0001. The only information we had received was in April 2022 when Propel communicated their decision to sell what had been their primary business for a $24 million note receivable, plus potential earnouts, in order to focus on their healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent. Apparently, we never updated our google alerts because on May 13 of this year we received an alert about IQVIA Holdings (IQV) acquisition of Propel Media potentially being blocked by the FTC (link). This was the first report that there even was a potential acquisition of Propel. What got our attention (massive understatement) was the reported price in the article of $700 to $800 million. Assuming no change in the outstanding shares that would be equal to $2.77 to $3.17 per share. Wow! A $0.10 stock possibly being worth $3 per share. We confirmed the share count at otcmarkets.com was essentially unchanged at just over 252 million. We unfortunately had no way to confirm the potential purchase price – we had to trust that the journalist actually had multiple sources and got it right. Would the stock price of an expert market illiquid security react to a Politico article noting a possible merger? If so, how long would it take? The price of a listed stock typically reacts within minutes or even seconds. An unlisted stock can take hours or occasionally a few days, but volume is usually only enough for a small investor to make a decent gain. Interestingly, the article did not contain ticker links so it did not show up on financial news platforms for Iqvia or Propel. As we write this neither company has mentioned the possible acquisition. More importantly, could we get shares in an illiquid, expert market security with public news of it possibly being acquired? It was a long shot but worth trying. We already had in place a 100,000 share “stink bid” at $0.01 per share for a while with no hits. Our broker said there were 5,000 shares available at $0.10 per share. While hardly meaningful we took them. Another 5,000 shares came on the market and we bought those too. Combined that was $1,000 plus commissions. Certainly not meaningful. We ended the day buying 20,000 shares at $0.10 per share. We raised our bid to $0.15 per share, which was the high bid, and waited. And waited. And waited. There were no sellers at all. Nearly a month goes by with nothing happening. On June 14 a small seller of 23,000 shares shows up at $0.30. We didn’t want to cause a big price jump, but we decided to take them and keep our bid at $0.15. While we were making some progress, it was still not meaningful in relation to the fund’s size. Then my broker called to say another seller showed up with 2,500 shares at $0.35 and he thinks there may be some size behind it, meaning the seller likely wants to sell more shares than what was being displayed. The broker engaged in negotiations with the selling broker and near the end of the trading day the fund purchased just over 300,000 shares at $0.25 per share. At cost, the $75,000 was still not significant, but if Propel were to be bought for $3 per share it would be nearly a $1 million gain. That is meaningful for Cedar Creek. The next day, June 15, we put out a bid for 200,000 shares at $0.25 to see if the seller was still there, with instructions to buy up to one million shares. Crickets. Bummer. A few hours later my broker emails me that he had negotiated a purchase of one million shares at $0.24. Now we are talking. We added another 750,000 later in the day. At day end, we owned over 2.1 million shares at a cost basis of roughly $0.25 per share. We added another 98,000 shares on June 16. We continued our due diligence (see below) and purchased another million shares the following week. That made it our 6th largest position at around 5% of the fund. We must have exhausted the seller because the ask jumped to near a $1 and less than 1,000 shares have traded in nearly a month. If the acquisition is consummated at the current terms, of roughly $3 per share, we would have a return of 12 times our cost basis, which works out to roughly a 50% gain for fund as a whole, net of fees. We had no idea what will happen. We expected both the seller and buyer to work diligently at alleviating any concerns the FTC had. On July 17 the FTC announced that they were suing to block the transaction (link). While approval would have been ideal, the FTC filing suit does not kill the deal. The FTC had done the same thing, with similar reasoning in the Microsoft / Activision Blizzard transaction and the courts sided against the FTC. A court date for the Iqvia / Propel Media matter was set for December 2023. Possible outcomes are: 1) The court rules in favor of Iqvia and Propel and the deal goes through!!! 2) The court rules in favor of the FTC and blocks the deal. That means Propel has to be valued on its own merits and maximum value is the price of the next best acquirer, which would most likely be below $700 to $800 million. For us to lose money, the value as a going concern or what the next strategic buyer would be willing to pay would have to be less than 1/10 of what IQVIA is willing to pay. That seems highly unlikely. We also think it is reasonable to conclude that it is more likely than not that Propel is profitable, or about to turn the corner on profitability. Why else would IQVIA pay $700 to $800 million? We had Propel’s 2018 and 2019 annual reports which thankfully broke out the revenue of the healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent, at $3.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively. It also noted an operating loss for DeepIntent of $4.3 million for 2018 and $2.4 million for 2019. Revenue grew significantly faster than costs in both 2018 and 2019. We combed through DeepIntent press releases and other news articles on the company, and found the following interesting data points: • DeepIntent press release announced that revenue had increased by 300% or more for four consecutive years between 2017 and 2020 (article). Apparently, someone at DeepIntent is not very good at math – 2019 revenue was $10.5 million versus $3.5 million in 2018, a 200% increase, not 300%. Revenues tripling is 200% growth not 300%. The article noted that 2020 also had 300% growth, so we know it was greater than 200%, which would put 2020 revenue between $31 to $42 million (we split the difference in our estimate below). • We found a release that noted that DeepIntent had more than doubled in revenue annually from 2016 to 2021. For 2021 we are comfortable projecting a doubling of 2020 revenue to a range of $61 to $84 million. • We could not find specific revenue growth for 2022. DeepIntent said in a release that they grew revenues in both 2021 and 2022, and that 2022 had robust year-over-year growth. We would not define growth of under 25% as robust, so we assumed 50% growth in 2022. • A number of reports on employee growth line up with our revenue projections. For example, we read that employee growth doubled in 2020 and was planned to double again in 2021. • We also found that SLR Investment Corp (SLRC) granted an ABL facility to DeepIntent, which had $16.9 million drawn at yearend out of $20 million of borrowing capacity (p. 7 and 30 of SLR’s 3/31/23 10-Q). Most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85% to 90% of receivables. That level of accounts receivable would exceed our revenue estimates assuming 60 day average receivables (60 days of receivables would equal roughly 1/6 of annual revenue, thus 20 million divided by 90% capacity times 6 = 133 million of annual revenue). DeepIntent 2017A 2018A 2019A 2020 E 2021 E 2022 E 2023 E Revenues 831 3,491 10,455 36,593 73,185 109,778 146,004 % growth 320% 199% 250% 100% 50% 33% Expenses 2,691 7,789 12,856 35,354 65,405 94,837 123,288 % growth 189% 65% 175% 85% 45% 30% Op Income (loss) (1,860) (4,298) (2,401) 1,239 7,780 14,940 22,716 per share $ (0.01) $ (0.02) $ (0.01) $ 0.01 $ 0.03 $ 0.06 $ 0.09 In 000’s. 2018 and 2019 are from Propel annual report. 2020-2023 are rough estimates by us Our conclusion was that even if the deal does not close, we are gaining ownership in a fast- growing company at a very attractive price. At $0.24 per share the market cap is $60 million, which is not only less than 10% of what Iqvia is willing to pay, it is less than half our estimate of current revenue, and possibly two to three times earnings. Update – on July 19, 2023, the Wall Street Journal had an interesting article (paywall) on the changes in how the FTC was viewing acquisitions. It focused on the FTC’s adoption of new guidelines and how it viewed vertical mergers, in particular. The FTC was saying they were just codifying current law in their guidelines, while others argued the FTC was putting forth guidelines that have not been successful in courts lately. Time will tell if we truly found that amazing opportunity in the expert market or not, but so far, the signs are very positive. Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.49 to $0.47 per unit. The special meeting was held on July 12. 96% of unitholders voting supported removal of Bank of New York Mellon as trustee. 93% of those who voted supported allocating the costs to the Trust instead of having them borne by the group who called the Special Meeting; however, it needed 75% of all units outstanding to be in favor and it only achieved 59% due to the 66% turnout. We were very pleased with the result. It was an important first step and we look forward to unitholders being better represented and ultimately being treated fairly, which we do not think is currently happening. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first quarter of 2023 were roughly $1.70 per share. Second quarter call report was released today, and earnings increased to roughly $1.85 per share. Annualized, earnings are approximately $7 per share, which is quite low in relation to its $42 share price. We were one of three shareholders at their annual meeting and came away very impressed with the board, management, and their conservative approach to lending. They have already opened loan production offices in Tennessee and Texas. It was also announced that they participated in a syndicated loan to the NFL. M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank that was the second of the two banks we purchased that were recipients of funds through the US Treasury ECIP program. M&F received $80 million of low-cost capital. Due to the bank contagion the share price declined in the quarter from $22 per share to $20.75 per share. Our cost basis is under $12. M&F earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Most of the earnings increase was from ECIP funds being moved into short-term treasuries earning 4-5%. A buyer today is paying 6 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making loans. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 6% in the second quarter of 2023 from $10.10 per share to $10.70 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron announced fiscal 2023 results and the signing of a non- binding term sheet for a potential acquisition. The target company produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. Revenue for 2022 was approximately $5.9 million as compared to $5.5 million in 2021. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The NASDAQ continued to destroy the other major US indices in the second quarter and first
half of 2023. The NASDAQ rose 12.8% in the quarter and was up 31.7% for the first half.
The tech leaders of the NASDAQ were largely responsible for the strong performance of the
S&P 500 as well. Cedar Creek decreased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and was up 3.7%
for the first half of 2023, net of fees and expenses.1 Under performance versus the Russell
2000 and Russell Micro Cap was primarily attributable to our higher bank exposure during the
quarter.
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/2 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 883.9%, net of fees and expenses.

$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $983,863
as of June 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we
compare against would have only grown to between $261,642 in the Russell Micro Cap and
$595,066 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.0
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 7.6 times
assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO
assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted
price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 1.9%. Weighted expected return on equity as of
June 30, 2023, was 25%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 16% and ended the quarter at 8%. We continued
to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC Corp (FIEB). First
IC is a community bank focused on the Korean community that was not a recipient of funds
through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It trades on the expert market
and was selling for about three times trailing earnings, about half of book value, and had a
dividend yield of 16%. PD-Rx is also on the expert market and trades at three times trailing
earnings, and just over one times earnings net of cash.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased significantly in the quarter,
due to purchases noted above in PD-Rx and First IC, and due to the purchase of Propel
Media (PROM) profiled below. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule
15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for
non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts,
depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter
with 27% exposure and ended at 37% of the fund.
Three positions make up about 65% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX), which is about 12% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL), which is roughly 6.5% of the fund, and Propel Media (PROM) is about 5.5%. We
discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in
our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link).
Amazing Opportunity in the Expert Market We Have Waited For
While we thought it was a stupid decision by the SEC and harmful to retail investors, our
hope was that the expert market would create occasional opportunities to put capital to work

Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) which could be worth five times its current price if, as we
believe, the improper assessment of asset retirement obligations to the trust is reversed by
the courts. While both of those opportunities are very attractive, we had yet to come across
the opportunity we were hoping for. That changed in the quarter.
Propel Media (PROM) – trades on the expert market. We briefly covered it in our 2020 first
quarter letter (link). At the time it had 246 million shares outstanding. It traded around
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We
project $0.22 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust.

$0.13 per share and earnings in 2018 were $23 million, or $0.09 per share. Earnings were
being used to pay down debt.
We sold the entire position at up to $0.29 in the second quarter of 2021 and explained our
reasoning - we had achieved a decent gain and the business was declining – earnings had
fallen to $0.04 per share in 2019 and the outlook was not positive.
We felt fine about our decision as the stock rarely traded after implementation of Rule 15c2-
11 forced it onto the expert market. In fact, between January 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023
it appears only about 20,000 shares traded. Most at $0.10 per share, which the fund actually

buyer to work diligently at alleviating any concerns the FTC had. On July 17 the FTC
announced that they were suing to block the transaction (link). While approval would have
been ideal, the FTC filing suit does not kill the deal. The FTC had done the same thing, with
similar reasoning in the Microsoft / Activision Blizzard transaction and the courts sided against
the FTC. A court date for the Iqvia / Propel Media matter was set for December 2023.
Possible outcomes are:
1) The court rules in favor of Iqvia and Propel and the deal goes through!!!
2) The court rules in favor of the FTC and blocks the deal. That means Propel has to be
valued on its own merits and maximum value is the price of the next best acquirer,
which would most likely be below $700 to $800 million. For us to lose money, the
value as a going concern or what the next strategic buyer would be willing to pay
would have to be less than 1/10 of what IQVIA is willing to pay. That seems highly
unlikely. We also think it is reasonable to conclude that it is more likely than not that
Propel is profitable, or about to turn the corner on profitability. Why else would IQVIA
pay $700 to $800 million?
We had Propel’s 2018 and 2019 annual reports which thankfully broke out the revenue of the
healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent, at $3.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively.
It also noted an operating loss for DeepIntent of $4.3 million for 2018 and $2.4 million for
2019. Revenue grew significantly faster than costs in both 2018 and 2019.
We combed through DeepIntent press releases and other news articles on the company, and
found the following interesting data points:
• DeepIntent press release announced that revenue had increased by 300% or more
for four consecutive years between 2017 and 2020 (article). Apparently, someone at
DeepIntent is not very good at math – 2019 revenue was $10.5 million versus $3.5
million in 2018, a 200% increase, not 300%. Revenues tripling is 200% growth not
300%. The article noted that 2020 also had 300% growth, so we know it was greater
than 200%, which would put 2020 revenue between $31 to $42 million (we split the
difference in our estimate below).
• We found a release that noted that DeepIntent had more than doubled in revenue
annually from 2016 to 2021. For 2021 we are comfortable projecting a doubling of
2020 revenue to a range of $61 to $84 million.
• We could not find specific revenue growth for 2022. DeepIntent said in a release that
they grew revenues in both 2021 and 2022, and that 2022 had robust year-over-year
growth. We would not define growth of under 25% as robust, so we assumed 50%
growth in 2022.
• A number of reports on employee growth line up with our revenue projections. For
example, we read that employee growth doubled in 2020 and was planned to double
again in 2021.
4 At this point we had to add to our analysis proper position sizing. How much do we buy? Is this really a
speculative play, or a once in a lifetime opportunity of nearly free upside?

• We also found that SLR Investment Corp (SLRC) granted an ABL facility5 to
DeepIntent, which had $16.9 million drawn at yearend out of $20 million of borrowing
capacity (p. 7 and 30 of SLR’s 3/31/23 10-Q). Most lenders limit borrowing capacity
to 85% to 90% of receivables. That level of accounts receivable would exceed our
revenue estimates assuming 60 day average receivables (60 days of receivables would
equal roughly 1/6 of annual revenue, thus 20 million divided by 90% capacity times
6 = 133 million of annual revenue).

In 000’s. 2018 and 2019 are from Propel annual report. 2020-2023 are rough estimates by us6
Our conclusion was that even if the deal does not close, we are gaining ownership in a fast-
growing company at a very attractive price. At $0.24 per share the market cap is $60 million,
which is not only less than 10% of what Iqvia is willing to pay, it is less than half our estimate
of current revenue, and possibly two to three times earnings.
Update – on July 19, 2023, the Wall Street Journal had an interesting article (paywall) on the
changes in how the FTC was viewing acquisitions. It focused on the FTC’s adoption of new
guidelines and how it viewed vertical mergers, in particular. The FTC was saying they were
just codifying current law in their guidelines, while others argued the FTC was putting forth
guidelines that have not been successful in courts lately.
Time will tell if we truly found that amazing opportunity in the expert market or not, but so
far, the signs are very positive.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.49 to $0.47 per unit. The special
meeting was held on July 12. 96% of unitholders voting supported removal of Bank of New
York Mellon as trustee. 93% of those who voted supported allocating the costs to the Trust
instead of having them borne by the group who called the Special Meeting; however, it
needed 75% of all units outstanding to be in favor and it only achieved 59% due to the 66%
turnout. We were very pleased with the result. It was an important first step and we look
forward to unitholders being better represented and ultimately being treated fairly, which we
do not think is currently happening.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file
quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first quarter
of 2023 were roughly $1.70 per share. Second quarter call report was released today, and
5 ABL is asset based lending
6 We recognize the possibility that we could be significantly off in our revenue, margin and especially profitability
estimates.

earnings increased to roughly $1.85 per share. Annualized, earnings are approximately $7
per share, which is quite low in relation to its $42 share price.
We were one of three shareholders at their annual meeting and came away very impressed
with the board, management, and their conservative approach to lending. They have already
opened loan production offices in Tennessee and Texas. It was also announced that they
participated in a syndicated loan to the NFL.
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank that was the second of the two banks
we purchased that were recipients of funds through the US Treasury ECIP program. M&F
received $80 million of low-cost capital. Due to the bank contagion the share price declined
in the quarter from $22 per share to $20.75 per share. Our cost basis is under $12. M&F
earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.81 per share in the
fourth quarter of 2022 and $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Most of the earnings
increase was from ECIP funds being moved into short-term treasuries earning 4-5%.
A buyer today is paying 6 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double
from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making
loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient
banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 6% in the second quarter
of 2023 from $10.10 per share to $10.70 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron announced fiscal 2023 results and the signing of a non-
binding term sheet for a potential acquisition. The target company produces electronic
components primarily for the medical industry. Revenue for 2022 was approximately $5.9
million as compared to $5.5 million in 2021.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The NASDAQ rose 12.8% in the quarter and was up 31.7% for the first half. The tech leaders of the NASDAQ were largely responsible for the strong performance of the S&P 500 as well. Cedar Creek decreased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and was up 3.7% for the first half of 2023, net of fees and expenses. Under performance versus the Russell 2000 and Russell Micro Cap was primarily attributable to our higher bank exposure during the quarter. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/2 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 883.9%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘23 1H ’23 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -2.5% 3.7% 883.9% 14.0% NASDAQ 12.8% 31.7% 495.1% 10.8% S&P 500 (SPY) 8.7% 16.8% 383.6% 9.4% DJIA (DIA) 3.9% 4.8% 368.2% 9.2% Russell 2000 5.2% 8.1% 237.6% 7.2% Russell Microcap 5.3% 2.3% 161.6% 5.7% $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $983,863 as of June 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $261,642 in the Russell Micro Cap and $595,066 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.0 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 7.6 times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 1.9%. Weighted expected return on equity as of June 30, 2023, was 25%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 16% and ended the quarter at 8%. We continued to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC Corp (FIEB). First IC is a community bank focused on the Korean community that was not a recipient of funds through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It trades on the expert market and was selling for about three times trailing earnings, about half of book value, and had a dividend yield of 16%. PD-Rx is also on the expert market and trades at three times trailing earnings, and just over one times earnings net of cash. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased significantly in the quarter, due to purchases noted above in PD-Rx and First IC, and due to the purchase of Propel Media (PROM) profiled below. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 27% exposure and ended at 37% of the fund. Three positions make up about 65% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX), which is about 12% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which is roughly 6.5% of the fund, and Propel Media (PROM) is about 5.5%. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link). Amazing Opportunity in the Expert Market We Have Waited For While we thought it was a stupid decision by the SEC and harmful to retail investors, our hope was that the expert market would create occasional opportunities to put capital to work at incredibly attractive prices. For the first year we were able to build positions in PD-Rx and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) which could be worth five times its current price if, as we believe, the improper assessment of asset retirement obligations to the trust is reversed by the courts. While both of those opportunities are very attractive, we had yet to come across the opportunity we were hoping for. That changed in the quarter. Propel Media (PROM) – trades on the expert market. We briefly covered it in our 2020 first quarter letter (link). At the time it had 246 million shares outstanding. It traded around $0.13 per share and earnings in 2018 were $23 million, or $0.09 per share. Earnings were being used to pay down debt. We sold the entire position at up to $0.29 in the second quarter of 2021 and explained our reasoning - we had achieved a decent gain and the business was declining – earnings had fallen to $0.04 per share in 2019 and the outlook was not positive. We felt fine about our decision as the stock rarely traded after implementation of Rule 15c2- 11 forced it onto the expert market. In fact, between January 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023 it appears only about 20,000 shares traded. Most at $0.10 per share, which the fund actually bought, and about 1,000 shares at $0.01 and an even smaller amount at $0.0001. The only information we had received was in April 2022 when Propel communicated their decision to sell what had been their primary business for a $24 million note receivable, plus potential earnouts, in order to focus on their healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent. Apparently, we never updated our google alerts because on May 13 of this year we received an alert about IQVIA Holdings (IQV) acquisition of Propel Media potentially being blocked by the FTC (link). This was the first report that there even was a potential acquisition of Propel. What got our attention (massive understatement) was the reported price in the article of $700 to $800 million. Assuming no change in the outstanding shares that would be equal to $2.77 to $3.17 per share. Wow! A $0.10 stock possibly being worth $3 per share. We confirmed the share count at otcmarkets.com was essentially unchanged at just over 252 million. We unfortunately had no way to confirm the potential purchase price – we had to trust that the journalist actually had multiple sources and got it right. Would the stock price of an expert market illiquid security react to a Politico article noting a possible merger? If so, how long would it take? The price of a listed stock typically reacts within minutes or even seconds. An unlisted stock can take hours or occasionally a few days, but volume is usually only enough for a small investor to make a decent gain. Interestingly, the article did not contain ticker links so it did not show up on financial news platforms for Iqvia or Propel. As we write this neither company has mentioned the possible acquisition. More importantly, could we get shares in an illiquid, expert market security with public news of it possibly being acquired? It was a long shot but worth trying. We already had in place a 100,000 share “stink bid” at $0.01 per share for a while with no hits. Our broker said there were 5,000 shares available at $0.10 per share. While hardly meaningful we took them. Another 5,000 shares came on the market and we bought those too. Combined that was $1,000 plus commissions. Certainly not meaningful. We ended the day buying 20,000 shares at $0.10 per share. We raised our bid to $0.15 per share, which was the high bid, and waited. And waited. And waited. There were no sellers at all. Nearly a month goes by with nothing happening. On June 14 a small seller of 23,000 shares shows up at $0.30. We didn’t want to cause a big price jump, but we decided to take them and keep our bid at $0.15. While we were making some progress, it was still not meaningful in relation to the fund’s size. Then my broker called to say another seller showed up with 2,500 shares at $0.35 and he thinks there may be some size behind it, meaning the seller likely wants to sell more shares than what was being displayed. The broker engaged in negotiations with the selling broker and near the end of the trading day the fund purchased just over 300,000 shares at $0.25 per share. At cost, the $75,000 was still not significant, but if Propel were to be bought for $3 per share it would be nearly a $1 million gain. That is meaningful for Cedar Creek. The next day, June 15, we put out a bid for 200,000 shares at $0.25 to see if the seller was still there, with instructions to buy up to one million shares. Crickets. Bummer. A few hours later my broker emails me that he had negotiated a purchase of one million shares at $0.24. Now we are talking. We added another 750,000 later in the day. At day end, we owned over 2.1 million shares at a cost basis of roughly $0.25 per share. We added another 98,000 shares on June 16. We continued our due diligence (see below) and purchased another million shares the following week. That made it our 6th largest position at around 5% of the fund. We must have exhausted the seller because the ask jumped to near a $1 and less than 1,000 shares have traded in nearly a month. If the acquisition is consummated at the current terms, of roughly $3 per share, we would have a return of 12 times our cost basis, which works out to roughly a 50% gain for fund as a whole, net of fees. We had no idea what will happen. We expected both the seller and buyer to work diligently at alleviating any concerns the FTC had. On July 17 the FTC announced that they were suing to block the transaction (link). While approval would have been ideal, the FTC filing suit does not kill the deal. The FTC had done the same thing, with similar reasoning in the Microsoft / Activision Blizzard transaction and the courts sided against the FTC. A court date for the Iqvia / Propel Media matter was set for December 2023. Possible outcomes are: 1) The court rules in favor of Iqvia and Propel and the deal goes through!!! 2) The court rules in favor of the FTC and blocks the deal. That means Propel has to be valued on its own merits and maximum value is the price of the next best acquirer, which would most likely be below $700 to $800 million. For us to lose money, the value as a going concern or what the next strategic buyer would be willing to pay would have to be less than 1/10 of what IQVIA is willing to pay. That seems highly unlikely. We also think it is reasonable to conclude that it is more likely than not that Propel is profitable, or about to turn the corner on profitability. Why else would IQVIA pay $700 to $800 million? We had Propel’s 2018 and 2019 annual reports which thankfully broke out the revenue of the healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent, at $3.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively. It also noted an operating loss for DeepIntent of $4.3 million for 2018 and $2.4 million for 2019. Revenue grew significantly faster than costs in both 2018 and 2019. We combed through DeepIntent press releases and other news articles on the company, and found the following interesting data points: • DeepIntent press release announced that revenue had increased by 300% or more for four consecutive years between 2017 and 2020 (article). Apparently, someone at DeepIntent is not very good at math – 2019 revenue was $10.5 million versus $3.5 million in 2018, a 200% increase, not 300%. Revenues tripling is 200% growth not 300%. The article noted that 2020 also had 300% growth, so we know it was greater than 200%, which would put 2020 revenue between $31 to $42 million (we split the difference in our estimate below). • We found a release that noted that DeepIntent had more than doubled in revenue annually from 2016 to 2021. For 2021 we are comfortable projecting a doubling of 2020 revenue to a range of $61 to $84 million. • We could not find specific revenue growth for 2022. DeepIntent said in a release that they grew revenues in both 2021 and 2022, and that 2022 had robust year-over-year growth. We would not define growth of under 25% as robust, so we assumed 50% growth in 2022. • A number of reports on employee growth line up with our revenue projections. For example, we read that employee growth doubled in 2020 and was planned to double again in 2021. • We also found that SLR Investment Corp (SLRC) granted an ABL facility to DeepIntent, which had $16.9 million drawn at yearend out of $20 million of borrowing capacity (p. 7 and 30 of SLR’s 3/31/23 10-Q). Most lenders limit borrowing capacity to 85% to 90% of receivables. That level of accounts receivable would exceed our revenue estimates assuming 60 day average receivables (60 days of receivables would equal roughly 1/6 of annual revenue, thus 20 million divided by 90% capacity times 6 = 133 million of annual revenue).

The special meeting was held on July 12. 96% of unitholders voting supported removal of Bank of New York Mellon as trustee. 93% of those who voted supported allocating the costs to the Trust instead of having them borne by the group who called the Special Meeting; however, it needed 75% of all units outstanding to be in favor and it only achieved 59% due to the 66% turnout. We were very pleased with the result. It was an important first step and we look forward to unitholders being better represented and ultimately being treated fairly, which we do not think is currently happening. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first quarter of 2023 were roughly $1.70 per share. Second quarter call report was released today, and earnings increased to roughly $1.85 per share. Annualized, earnings are approximately $7 per share, which is quite low in relation to its $42 share price. We were one of three shareholders at their annual meeting and came away very impressed with the board, management, and their conservative approach to lending. They have already opened loan production offices in Tennessee and Texas. It was also announced that they participated in a syndicated loan to the NFL. M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank that was the second of the two banks we purchased that were recipients of funds through the US Treasury ECIP program. M&F received $80 million of low-cost capital. Due to the bank contagion the share price declined in the quarter from $22 per share to $20.75 per share. Our cost basis is under $12. M&F earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Most of the earnings increase was from ECIP funds being moved into short-term treasuries earning 4-5%.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The NASDAQ continued to destroy the other major US indices in the second quarter and first
half of 2023. The NASDAQ rose 12.8% in the quarter and was up 31.7% for the first half.
The tech leaders of the NASDAQ were largely responsible for the strong performance of the
S&P 500 as well. Cedar Creek decreased by 2.5% in the second quarter, and was up 3.7%
for the first half of 2023, net of fees and expenses.1 Under performance versus the Russell
2000 and Russell Micro Cap was primarily attributable to our higher bank exposure during the
quarter.
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/2 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 883.9%, net of fees and expenses.

* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $983,863
as of June 30, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we
compare against would have only grown to between $261,642 in the Russell Micro Cap and
$595,066 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.0
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 7.6 times
assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO
assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted
price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 1.9%. Weighted expected return on equity as of
June 30, 2023, was 25%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 16% and ended the quarter at 8%. We continued
to increase our holdings in PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and First IC Corp (FIEB). First
IC is a community bank focused on the Korean community that was not a recipient of funds
through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It trades on the expert market
and was selling for about three times trailing earnings, about half of book value, and had a
dividend yield of 16%. PD-Rx is also on the expert market and trades at three times trailing
earnings, and just over one times earnings net of cash.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market increased significantly in the quarter,
due to purchases noted above in PD-Rx and First IC, and due to the purchase of Propel
Media (PROM) profiled below. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule
15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for
non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts,
depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter
with 27% exposure and ended at 37% of the fund.
Three positions make up about 65% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX), which is about 12% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL), which is roughly 6.5% of the fund, and Propel Media (PROM) is about 5.5%. We
discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in
our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link).
Amazing Opportunity in the Expert Market We Have Waited For
While we thought it was a stupid decision by the SEC and harmful to retail investors, our
hope was that the expert market would create occasional opportunities to put capital to work
at incredibly attractive prices. For the first year we were able to build positions in PD-Rx and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) which could be worth five times its current price if, as we
believe, the improper assessment of asset retirement obligations to the trust is reversed by
the courts. While both of those opportunities are very attractive, we had yet to come across
the opportunity we were hoping for. That changed in the quarter.
Propel Media (PROM) – trades on the expert market. We briefly covered it in our 2020 first
quarter letter (link). At the time it had 246 million shares outstanding. It traded around
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We
project $0.22 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust.

$0.13 per share and earnings in 2018 were $23 million, or $0.09 per share. Earnings were
being used to pay down debt.
We sold the entire position at up to $0.29 in the second quarter of 2021 and explained our
reasoning - we had achieved a decent gain and the business was declining – earnings had
fallen to $0.04 per share in 2019 and the outlook was not positive.
We felt fine about our decision as the stock rarely traded after implementation of Rule 15c2-
11 forced it onto the expert market. In fact, between January 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023
it appears only about 20,000 shares traded. Most at $0.10 per share, which the fund actually
bought, and about 1,000 shares at $0.01 and an even smaller amount at $0.0001. The only
information we had received was in April 2022 when Propel communicated their decision to
sell what had been their primary business for a $24 million note receivable, plus potential
earnouts, in order to focus on their healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent.
Apparently, we never updated our google alerts because on May 13 of this year we received
an alert about IQVIA Holdings (IQV) acquisition of Propel Media potentially being blocked
by the FTC (link).3 This was the first report that there even was a potential acquisition of
Propel. What got our attention (massive understatement) was the reported price in the article
of $700 to $800 million. Assuming no change in the outstanding shares that would be equal
to $2.77 to $3.17 per share. Wow! A $0.10 stock possibly being worth $3 per share. We
confirmed the share count at otcmarkets.com was essentially unchanged at just over 252
million. We unfortunately had no way to confirm the potential purchase price – we had to
trust that the journalist actually had multiple sources and got it right.
Would the stock price of an expert market illiquid security react to a Politico article noting a
possible merger? If so, how long would it take? The price of a listed stock typically reacts
within minutes or even seconds. An unlisted stock can take hours or occasionally a few days,
but volume is usually only enough for a small investor to make a decent gain. Interestingly,
the article did not contain ticker links so it did not show up on financial news platforms for
Iqvia or Propel. As we write this neither company has mentioned the possible acquisition.
More importantly, could we get shares in an illiquid, expert market security with public news
of it possibly being acquired? It was a long shot but worth trying. We already had in place a
100,000 share “stink bid” at $0.01 per share for a while with no hits. Our broker said there
were 5,000 shares available at $0.10 per share. While hardly meaningful we took them.
Another 5,000 shares came on the market and we bought those too. Combined that was
$1,000 plus commissions. Certainly not meaningful. We ended the day buying 20,000 shares
at $0.10 per share. We raised our bid to $0.15 per share, which was the high bid, and waited.
And waited. And waited. There were no sellers at all. Nearly a month goes by with nothing
happening. On June 14 a small seller of 23,000 shares shows up at $0.30. We didn’t want
to cause a big price jump, but we decided to take them and keep our bid at $0.15. While we
were making some progress, it was still not meaningful in relation to the fund’s size. Then
my broker called to say another seller showed up with 2,500 shares at $0.35 and he thinks
there may be some size behind it, meaning the seller likely wants to sell more shares than
what was being displayed.
The broker engaged in negotiations with the selling broker and near the end of the trading
day the fund purchased just over 300,000 shares at $0.25 per share. At cost, the $75,000
was still not significant, but if Propel were to be bought for $3 per share it would be nearly a
$1 million gain. That is meaningful for Cedar Creek. The next day, June 15, we put out a
bid for 200,000 shares at $0.25 to see if the seller was still there, with instructions to buy up
to one million shares. Crickets. Bummer. A few hours later my broker emails me that he
had negotiated a purchase of one million shares at $0.24. Now we are talking. We added
3 All acquisitions in the US greater than $100 million go through FTC or Department of Justice review.

another 750,000 later in the day.4 At day end, we owned over 2.1 million shares at a cost
basis of roughly $0.25 per share. We added another 98,000 shares on June 16. We continued
our due diligence (see below) and purchased another million shares the following week. That
made it our 6th largest position at around 5% of the fund. We must have exhausted the seller
because the ask jumped to near a $1 and less than 1,000 shares have traded in nearly a
month.
If the acquisition is consummated at the current terms, of roughly $3 per share, we would
have a return of 12 times our cost basis, which works out to roughly a 50% gain for fund as
a whole, net of fees. We had no idea what will happen. We expected both the seller and
buyer to work diligently at alleviating any concerns the FTC had. On July 17 the FTC
announced that they were suing to block the transaction (link). While approval would have
been ideal, the FTC filing suit does not kill the deal. The FTC had done the same thing, with
similar reasoning in the Microsoft / Activision Blizzard transaction and the courts sided against
the FTC. A court date for the Iqvia / Propel Media matter was set for December 2023.
Possible outcomes are:
1) The court rules in favor of Iqvia and Propel and the deal goes through!!!
2) The court rules in favor of the FTC and blocks the deal. That means Propel has to be
valued on its own merits and maximum value is the price of the next best acquirer,
which would most likely be below $700 to $800 million. For us to lose money, the
value as a going concern or what the next strategic buyer would be willing to pay
would have to be less than 1/10 of what IQVIA is willing to pay. That seems highly
unlikely. We also think it is reasonable to conclude that it is more likely than not that
Propel is profitable, or about to turn the corner on profitability. Why else would IQVIA
pay $700 to $800 million?
We had Propel’s 2018 and 2019 annual reports which thankfully broke out the revenue of the
healthcare advertising business, DeepIntent, at $3.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively.
It also noted an operating loss for DeepIntent of $4.3 million for 2018 and $2.4 million for
2019. Revenue grew significantly faster than costs in both 2018 and 2019.
We combed through DeepIntent press releases and other news articles on the company, and
found the following interesting data points:
• DeepIntent press release announced that revenue had increased by 300% or more
for four consecutive years between 2017 and 2020 (article). Apparently, someone at
DeepIntent is not very good at math – 2019 revenue was $10.5 million versus $3.5
million in 2018, a 200% increase, not 300%. Revenues tripling is 200% growth not
300%. The article noted that 2020 also had 300% growth, so we know it was greater
than 200%, which would put 2020 revenue between $31 to $42 million (we split the
difference in our estimate below).
• We found a release that noted that DeepIntent had more than doubled in revenue
annually from 2016 to 2021. For 2021 we are comfortable projecting a doubling of
2020 revenue to a range of $61 to $84 million.
• We could not find specific revenue growth for 2022. DeepIntent said in a release that
they grew revenues in both 2021 and 2022, and that 2022 had robust year-over-year
growth. We would not define growth of under 25% as robust, so we assumed 50%
growth in 2022.
• A number of reports on employee growth line up with our revenue projections. For
example, we read that employee growth doubled in 2020 and was planned to double
again in 2021.
4 At this point we had to add to our analysis proper position sizing. How much do we buy? Is this really a
speculative play, or a once in a lifetime opportunity of nearly free upside?

• We also found that SLR Investment Corp (SLRC) granted an ABL facility5 to
DeepIntent, which had $16.9 million drawn at yearend out of $20 million of borrowing
capacity (p. 7 and 30 of SLR’s 3/31/23 10-Q). Most lenders limit borrowing capacity
to 85% to 90% of receivables. That level of accounts receivable would exceed our
revenue estimates assuming 60 day average receivables (60 days of receivables would
equal roughly 1/6 of annual revenue, thus 20 million divided by 90% capacity times
6 = 133 million of annual revenue).

Our conclusion was that even if the deal does not close, we are gaining ownership in a fast-
growing company at a very attractive price. At $0.24 per share the market cap is $60 million,
which is not only less than 10% of what Iqvia is willing to pay, it is less than half our estimate
of current revenue, and possibly two to three times earnings.
Update – on July 19, 2023, the Wall Street Journal had an interesting article (paywall) on the
changes in how the FTC was viewing acquisitions. It focused on the FTC’s adoption of new
guidelines and how it viewed vertical mergers, in particular. The FTC was saying they were
just codifying current law in their guidelines, while others argued the FTC was putting forth
guidelines that have not been successful in courts lately.
Time will tell if we truly found that amazing opportunity in the expert market or not, but so
far, the signs are very positive.
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.49 to $0.47 per unit. The special
meeting was held on July 12. 96% of unitholders voting supported removal of Bank of New
York Mellon as trustee. 93% of those who voted supported allocating the costs to the Trust
instead of having them borne by the group who called the Special Meeting; however, it
needed 75% of all units outstanding to be in favor and it only achieved 59% due to the 66%
turnout. We were very pleased with the result. It was an important first step and we look
forward to unitholders being better represented and ultimately being treated fairly, which we
do not think is currently happening.

estimates.

earnings increased to roughly $1.85 per share. Annualized, earnings are approximately $7
per share, which is quite low in relation to its $42 share price.
We were one of three shareholders at their annual meeting and came away very impressed
with the board, management, and their conservative approach to lending. They have already
opened loan production offices in Tennessee and Texas. It was also announced that they
participated in a syndicated loan to the NFL.
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank that was the second of the two banks
we purchased that were recipients of funds through the US Treasury ECIP program. M&F
received $80 million of low-cost capital. Due to the bank contagion the share price declined
in the quarter from $22 per share to $20.75 per share. Our cost basis is under $12. M&F
earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.81 per share in the
fourth quarter of 2022 and $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Most of the earnings
increase was from ECIP funds being moved into short-term treasuries earning 4-5%.
A buyer today is paying 6 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double
from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making
loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient
banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 6% in the second quarter
of 2023 from $10.10 per share to $10.70 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. During the quarter, Solitron announced fiscal 2023 results and the signing of a non-
binding term sheet for a potential acquisition. The target company produces electronic
components primarily for the medical industry. Revenue for 2022 was approximately $5.9
million as compared to $5.5 million in 2021.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

Letter to Limited Partners Third Quarter 2024

The cover image offers a view of the Montserrat mountain range in Catalonia,
Spain. These “serrated mountains”, as the name translates, are home to a
Benedictine Abbey as well as several paths for hiking and climbing. On a clear
day, anyone reaching the summit at Sant Jeroni can see as far as the Pyrenees
to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the east.
In much closer proximity to Sant Jeroni, an antenna sited on the neighboring
Mirador del Moro peak stands out among the rugged terrain. Built atop
what was once the upper station for the steepest cable car in Europe, this
telecommunications station is currently in use by one of Alluvial Fund’s newest
holdings: Zegona Communications. Continue reading the letter to learn more

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund had a quiet third quarter, rising 4.8%. Comparable indexes fared better with the
Russell 2000 returning 9.8% and the Russell MicroCap Index returning 9.9%. Year-to-date, Alluvial
Fund remains ahead of benchmarks with a net return of 15.7%. Alluvial’s portfolio is full of mostly
boring companies making, doing, and owning mostly boring things. Profitable, cash-generating
things, but undeniably dull. Offices, envelopes, agricultural loans, laundry detergents, cement,
industrial hoses, and canned vegetables do not quicken the pulse for most. When the market has
one of its periodic fits of excitement, is it not usually our companies that benefit. The opposite is
also true, of course. The plodding approach has worked well for us over time, and I see no reason
to deviate from it, even if it occasionally feels like looking forlornly through a window at a convivial
dinner party to which we were not invited.

Partnership began operations 01/01/2017
I have been looking forward to writing this letter because there’s so much to discuss. I want to
introduce two new holdings and provide some updates on others. First, the new.
New Holdings
Our most significant new holding is Zegona Communications. Zegona is a special situation that
I believe will return multiples of our purchase price over the next 2-3 years. The Zegona story is
complicated but is essentially a turnaround play in which experienced telecom executives are
tackling an underperforming European telecom operator. Let’s back up a few years. Two former
Virgin Media executives, Eamonn O’Hare and Robert Samuelson, established Zegona back in 2015
with the goal of buying a struggling telecom company, fixing the issues, then selling it. Zegona
proceeded to buy Telecable, a lackluster Spanish cable provider. Two years later, Zegona sold
Telecable for a 15% stake in Euskaltel. The team then increased Zegona’s investment in Euskaltel
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

and took charge, hiring top people, cutting costs, and improving product offerings. In 2021,
MasMovil purchased Euskaltel at a nice premium. Zegona returned capital to shareholders through
a tender offer and began searching for its next “buy-fix-sell” opportunity.
This opportunity arrived in the form of Vodafone Spain. Vodafone Spain was an undermanaged
and non-core segment of Vodafone Group. Vodafone Group was over-indebted and facing a
downgrade to “junk” status if it did not sell assets, so it struck a deal to sell Vodafone Spain to
Zegona for €5.0 billion, a great price for the buyer. Zegona Communications funded the deal
through a share offering, seller financing from Vodafone, and bridge financing from a consortium
of European banks. Zegona put up only 6% of the deal’s value in cash. Echoes of the glory days of
leveraged buyouts, if you ask me. The deal closed in May 2024.
Deal accomplished, Zegona set out to right the ship at Vodafone Spain. First order of business:
replacing the bridge financing. In July, the company announced a new loan package with a 5-year
maturity. Following the announcement, Zegona announced that new Vodafone Spain CEO, Jose
Miguel García, had purchased €1.5 million worth of Zegona shares in the open market. Quite
a show of confidence. Next, Zegona’s cost structure had to be addressed. Vodafone Spain had
long struggled with inefficient operations and weak margins. A lack of management focus didn’t
help. Vodafone Spain’s CEO didn’t even live in the country! Zegona announced it would reduce
headcount by one-third, with more efficiency initiatives to follow. Finally, Zegona needed to realize
the value of its extensive network infrastructure. To that end, Zegona announced agreements
with both MasMovil and Telefonica to contribute network assets and form fibercos. When the
transactions are completed, Zegona will receive billions from the sale of its stake in the fibercos to
financial investors.
Currently, Zegona is the moderately-levered owner of a stagnant Spanish telecom player with weak
margins and no growth. But 2-3 years from now, I expect Zegona to be a lightly-levered owner of
a vibrant Spanish telecom with margins approaching industry averages and increasing customer
counts. The progress may not be linear and may at times be frustratingly slow. After all, a large
European telecom like Vodafone Spain does not turn on a dime. But improvements will happen all
the same and the value creation for shareholders will be extraordinary.
Another important new holding is Bahnhof AB. Bahnhof is a Swedish internet service provider. The
Alluvial Fund portfolio includes a few holdings I consider semi-permanent, with such incredible
economics that it is difficult to imagine finding better. Rand Worldwide is one. Boston Sand &
Gravel is another. Bahnhof AB could well join the pantheon.
Bahnhof has provided Swedes with internet since 1994. The firm is constantly winning awards for
speed, service, and privacy protections, all reasons that revenues have grown at an incredible 20%
annual pace over the last 15 years. Operating income has kept pace, growing at 27% annually over
the same timeframe. Even better, Bahnhof is startlingly efficient with its capital. A decade ago,
Bahnhof produced operating income of SEK 62 million on invested capital of 35 million. Impressive
enough! But in 2023, Bahnhof earned operating income of SEK 270 million while employing less
invested capital. The secret to Bahnhof’s financial success is two-fold. The company is light on
physical assets, needing only SEK 1 million in servers, offices, switches, etc. for every SEK 5 million
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

in revenue. But the company is wildly efficient with working capital, enjoying a deeply negative
working capital cycle that results in collecting payments from customers well before services are
rendered and suppliers are paid. I have written about the wonders of negative working capital
before, and Bahnhof is an excellent example. At year-end, Bahnhof’s net non-cash working capital
stood at negative 87 days, meaning that on average, the company receives customer payments
nearly 3 months before it pays suppliers and renders services to customers. Put another way,
when Bahnof signs up new customers that add say, SEK 10 million in incremental annual recurring
revenue, it also generates SEK 2.4 million in balance sheet cash before any actual profit associated
with serving these customers is earned.

needs.

Today, Bahnhof trades at 23x earnings, net

first to admit this is more than I like to pay

for a business. (Although, this view seems
Unidata S.p.A. 3.1
exceedingly quaint when I look at the
valuations of many members of the NASDAQ
Total, Top Ten 53.0%
100 or similar.) But there are times when
paying a mid-20s earnings multiple truly is a
bargain, and this is one of them. Bahnhof’s revenue growth will likely slow in coming years, though
the firm is busy making inroads in the surrounding Nordic countries and Germany. Still, I have no
doubt that Bahnhof’s profits will continue growing at a mid-teens pace for quite a few years to
come and that shareholders will be richly rewarded.
Holdings Updates
Net Lease Office Properties remains Alluvial Fund’s largest holding. In August, Net Lease sold
one of its best properties for $71.5 million, allowing it to reduce its term loan balance to $74
million and its mezzanine loan to $81 million. Less than a year into its corporate existence, Net
Lease Office Properties has reduced these loans by $300 million. The sale of just a few more
choice properties will allow Net Lease to extinguish its corporate-level debt in full and begin the
process of distributing cash to shareholders. I expect to receive the majority of our investment
back in 2025. Net Lease shares remain very cheap. I calculate the REIT’s enterprise value at $615
million against net operating income of $94 million, a cap rate of 15.3%. On a price per square
foot basis, the portfolio trades at $96. I continue to believe the remaining portfolio properties are
worth $130 per square foot, or $45 per share net of debt.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

McBride Plc shares have drifted down after hitting a high of £1.43 in July. At £1.15, shares change
hands for just 4.8x trailing adjusted operating income and 6x reported net income. McBride had
a great fiscal year, with both revenues and earnings at all-time highs. There’s no indication the
good times are about to end, either. In September’s annual results announcement, the company
indicated that trading has remained strong in the first months of fiscal 2025 and projected another
year of revenue growth with operating margins well above historical averages. The company
expects to reduce net debt by another £20 million. McBride continues to see tailwinds from
European customers opting for private label laundry soaps and detergents over name brands. I
expect the fruits of McBride’s years-long efficiency efforts to offset any significant margin pressures
in coming years. Bottom line, a steadily profitable producer of consumer staples should not trade
at a mid-single digit price-to-earnings ratio. Yes, this is the United Kingdom, where small-caps go
to die. But even so, someone will eventually notice McBride’s success. There are a few upcoming
catalysts that may hasten the process. I expect McBride will soon announce a refinancing of its
revolving credit facilities that will allow it to resume dividend payments in 2025. Even if McBride
chooses to distribute only 30% of its earnings, a nearly 8% dividend yield would be hard to ignore.
FitLife Brands recorded another strong quarter, with revenues up 15% year over year and earnings
per share up 33%. The company’s decision to concentrate on online sales continues to pay off in
the form of higher gross margins, which reached nearly 45% in the second quarter. Musclepharm,
acquired by FitLife nearly a year ago, is performing well, though it will take time to rebuild
relationships with former wholesalers. FitLife
is rapidly reducing acquisition debt and
TABLE III: World Allocation, 9/30/24 (%)
should soon be in position to perform another
meaningful acquisition. I trust CEO Dayton United States 60.6
Judd to find a great one.
United Kingdom 14.8
Talen Energy has been an incredible Eurozone 10.7
performer for the fund this year. Despite
Poland 4.6
pulling back from all-time highs, shares are
still up more than 150% year-to-date. Talen Sweden 3.6
was a classic situation in which an over-
leveraged company becomes insolvent thanks Canada 2.3
to a tough industry backdrop and a string of
bad luck, then exits bankruptcy into a much- Mexico 2.0
improved operating environment and with a
clean balance sheet. And since exiting, Talen Other 1.4
management has put on a master class: selling
non-core assets, executing a transformative agreement to supply power to Amazon data centers,
and repurchasing huge quantities of deeply under-valued shares. Despite the run-up in the shares,
Talen still looks reasonably valued given the rosy outlook for producers of carbon-free baseload
power like nuclear. In September, Talen introduced 2026 free cash flow guidance of $10.50-$17.50
per share, putting shares at 13.6x mid-point 2026 free cash flow as I write. I suspect Talen will easily
exceed the midpoint of the projection, in part because the figures are based on the current share
count of 51 million. Talen recently increased its share repurchase authorization to $1.25 billion by
the end of 2026, good for 13% of shares outstanding. Given the need to produce more reliable
baseload energy without contributing to harmful emissions, investors and governments around the
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

world are looking to nuclear energy again. But nuclear plants aren’t built in a day, and incumbents
will benefit from scarcity value for years to come.
The fund exited two positions in the third quarter, and another this month. I had been gradually
selling off our shares of Butler National since last year. Shares moved up substantially this year
on good earnings reports, so I elected to sell our remaining holdings as the discount to fair
value narrowed. I visited the company last year and liked what I heard about growth initiatives
and strategy, but I was bothered by what I saw as a weak board of directors with lavish board
remuneration. My fears were confirmed when not a week later, Butler National made a filing
disclosing that a board committee voted to grant another board member a whopping 300,000
shares (worth $250,000 at the time) as compensation for vague “investor relations services” during
the CEO transition. $250,000 for maybe twenty e-mails and phone calls, at most? Good work if
you can get it! This casual disregard for shareholders killed my confidence in the board’s ability to
properly oversee the company, so selling was an easy decision.
Selling Hammond Manufacturing was a tougher decision. I continue to like this small Canadian
manufacturer, but it has become more and more clear with time that management likes being
small and has no real intention of taking steps to maximize the company’s value or failing that,
sharing more than a small portion of earnings with shareholders. There are simply too many
good opportunities out there to place our capital with companies uninterested in seeing their
shareholders prosper.
Last, this month we exited Scandic Hotels. At the time of purchase, I made the case that Scandic’s
share price was depressed by an overhang of shares issuable when its large convertible bond
issued during the pandemic matured. Scandic repurchased a large portion of the bond issue, and
the rest converted on schedule. Shares rose 40% and were approaching fair value, so it was time
to sell and move on. I look forward to investing in Scandic Hotels for the third time in the history of
Alluvial Fund the next time a transient issue causes its shares to plunge.
Portfolio Themes
Alluvial Fund does not take a “thematic” approach. We don’t try to identify market trends and
then find ways to take advantage, rather we try to find cheap securities and if they happen to
have thematic tailwinds, all the better. We incorporate any positive or negative trends affecting a
business into our estimate of intrinsic value. Still, I think it is worthwhile to look at our holdings now
and then and ask “For this portfolio to perform well, what needs to be true? What exposure do we
have to various themes and trends, both current and developing?”
“Commercial real estate isn’t dead.” is a major theme for Alluvial Fund. Looking back, “______
industry isn’t dead” has been a frequent investment thesis for the fund, and one that has paid off
handsomely. I find the market is often directionally correct about the long-term trajectory of an
industry or asset class, but way off concerning the pace of the coming change and the short-term
impact on industry participants. Yes, it is likely true that the future demand for office space will be
permanently lower due to technological and demographic changes. But no, office vacancy rates
are not heading to the stratosphere. Marginal buildings will be demolished or repurposed, lease
rates will decline, the market will stabilize, and buildings will become financeable on reasonable
commercial terms once again. And that’s how investors make money.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

“Non-US markets are investable!” is another big theme expressed through the Alluvial Fund
portfolio, though recent history is doing its utmost to disprove the assertion. Alluvial has always
had a large allocation to non-US markets. We continue to find excellent value in small companies
that get even less attention than US counterparts and many have performed very well for us.
But the backdrop has been nothing short of grim. No tailwinds to be found. In 2014, when I
launched Alluvial Capital Management, the US stock market capitalization to GDP ratio was around
115%. Today it’s >200%. By contrast, the European Union’s 2014 ratio was around 55%. Is it not
substantially different in 2024. Not only has the European economy grown less quickly than the
USA’s, its companies remain modestly valued as a percentage of GDP while American companies
are more highly valued than ever before. Now, much of the gap is deserved. The American
economy is more vibrant, its workers more productive, and its companies more incentivized to
innovate and invest. Still, I am not convinced
these real advantages justify a valuation gap
TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 9/30/24 (%)
of this magnitude. At some point, unless
Consumer Staples 20.5
one believes there is no ceiling on American
market valuations, the tide will turn and Communications 15.5
our European holdings will finally enjoy a
Real Estate 14.6
favorable market environment. While it seems
almost unimaginable now, European markets Financials 12.7
used to outperform American markets at
Information Technology 9.9
regular intervals. From 2002 through 2007,
the MSCI EAFE Index returned 123% versus Consumer Discretionary 9.1
the S&P 500’s 42%.
Industrials 6.3
One last theme our portfolio expresses Materials 5.9
is “Business are run by people, so invest
Utilities 4.0
in good, well-incentivized people.” I say
“theme,” but this is really more of a core Energy 1.3
belief that gets stronger with time. It’s hardly
Health Care 0.3
a revolutionary idea, but I appreciate its value
more and more with each passing year. Fully Total 100%
40% of our portfolio is invested in companies
where management are the largest shareholders or a major shareholder is directly involved in the
business. In my experience, the more of their net worth that members of management have riding
on the success of a company, the more likely management is to do intelligent things that help that
company prosper.

Lease Office Properties has reduced these loans by $300 million. The sale of just a few more
choice properties will allow Net Lease to extinguish its corporate-level debt in full and begin the
process of distributing cash to shareholders. I expect to receive the majority of our investment
back in 2025. Net Lease shares remain very cheap. I calculate the REIT’s enterprise value at $615
million against net operating income of $94 million, a cap rate of 15.3%. On a price per square
foot basis, the portfolio trades at $96. I continue to believe the remaining portfolio properties are
worth $130 per square foot, or $45 per share net of debt.

McBride Plc shares have drifted down after hitting a high of £1.43 in July. At £1.15, shares change
hands for just 4.8x trailing adjusted operating income and 6x reported net income. McBride had
a great fiscal year, with both revenues and earnings at all-time highs. There’s no indication the
good times are about to end, either. In September’s annual results announcement, the company
indicated that trading has remained strong in the first months of fiscal 2025 and projected another
year of revenue growth with operating margins well above historical averages. The company
expects to reduce net debt by another £20 million. McBride continues to see tailwinds from
European customers opting for private label laundry soaps and detergents over name brands. I
expect the fruits of McBride’s years-long efficiency efforts to offset any significant margin pressures
in coming years. Bottom line, a steadily profitable producer of consumer staples should not trade
at a mid-single digit price-to-earnings ratio. Yes, this is the United Kingdom, where small-caps go
to die. But even so, someone will eventually notice McBride’s success. There are a few upcoming
catalysts that may hasten the process. I expect McBride will soon announce a refinancing of its
revolving credit facilities that will allow it to resume dividend payments in 2025. Even if McBride
chooses to distribute only 30% of its earnings, a nearly 8% dividend yield would be hard to ignore.
FitLife Brands recorded another strong quarter, with revenues up 15% year over year and earnings
per share up 33%. The company’s decision to concentrate on online sales continues to pay off in
the form of higher gross margins, which reached nearly 45% in the second quarter. Musclepharm,
acquired by FitLife nearly a year ago, is performing well, though it will take time to rebuild
relationships with former wholesalers. FitLife
is rapidly reducing acquisition debt and

management has put on a master class: selling
non-core assets, executing a transformative agreement to supply power to Amazon data centers,
and repurchasing huge quantities of deeply under-valued shares. Despite the run-up in the shares,
Talen still looks reasonably valued given the rosy outlook for producers of carbon-free baseload
power like nuclear. In September, Talen introduced 2026 free cash flow guidance of $10.50-$17.50
per share, putting shares at 13.6x mid-point 2026 free cash flow as I write. I suspect Talen will easily
exceed the midpoint of the projection, in part because the figures are based on the current share
count of 51 million. Talen recently increased its share repurchase authorization to $1.25 billion by
the end of 2026, good for 13% of shares outstanding. Given the need to produce more reliable

world are looking to nuclear energy again. But nuclear plants aren’t built in a day, and incumbents
will benefit from scarcity value for years to come.
The fund exited two positions in the third quarter, and another this month. I had been gradually
selling off our shares of Butler National since last year. Shares moved up substantially this year
on good earnings reports, so I elected to sell our remaining holdings as the discount to fair
value narrowed. I visited the company last year and liked what I heard about growth initiatives
and strategy, but I was bothered by what I saw as a weak board of directors with lavish board
remuneration. My fears were confirmed when not a week later, Butler National made a filing
disclosing that a board committee voted to grant another board member a whopping 300,000
shares (worth $250,000 at the time) as compensation for vague “investor relations services” during
the CEO transition. $250,000 for maybe twenty e-mails and phone calls, at most? Good work if
you can get it! This casual disregard for shareholders killed my confidence in the board’s ability to
properly oversee the company, so selling was an easy decision.
Selling Hammond Manufacturing was a tougher decision. I continue to like this small Canadian
manufacturer, but it has become more and more clear with time that management likes being
small and has no real intention of taking steps to maximize the company’s value or failing that,
sharing more than a small portion of earnings with shareholders. There are simply too many
good opportunities out there to place our capital with companies uninterested in seeing their
shareholders prosper.
Last, this month we exited Scandic Hotels. At the time of purchase, I made the case that Scandic’s
share price was depressed by an overhang of shares issuable when its large convertible bond
issued during the pandemic matured. Scandic repurchased a large portion of the bond issue, and
the rest converted on schedule. Shares rose 40% and were approaching fair value, so it was time
to sell and move on. I look forward to investing in Scandic Hotels for the third time in the history of
Alluvial Fund the next time a transient issue causes its shares to plunge.
Portfolio Themes
Alluvial Fund does not take a “thematic” approach. We don’t try to identify market trends and
then find ways to take advantage, rather we try to find cheap securities and if they happen to
have thematic tailwinds, all the better. We incorporate any positive or negative trends affecting a
business into our estimate of intrinsic value. Still, I think it is worthwhile to look at our holdings now
and then and ask “For this portfolio to perform well, what needs to be true? What exposure do we
have to various themes and trends, both current and developing?”
“Commercial real estate isn’t dead.” is a major theme for Alluvial Fund. Looking back, “______
industry isn’t dead” has been a frequent investment thesis for the fund, and one that has paid off
handsomely. I find the market is often directionally correct about the long-term trajectory of an
industry or asset class, but way off concerning the pace of the coming change and the short-term
impact on industry participants. Yes, it is likely true that the future demand for office space will be
permanently lower due to technological and demographic changes. But no, office vacancy rates
are not heading to the stratosphere. Marginal buildings will be demolished or repurposed, lease
rates will decline, the market will stabilize, and buildings will become financeable on reasonable
commercial terms once again. And that’s how investors make money.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2024 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

“Non-US markets are investable!” is another big theme expressed through the Alluvial Fund
portfolio, though recent history is doing its utmost to disprove the assertion. Alluvial has always
had a large allocation to non-US markets. We continue to find excellent value in small companies
that get even less attention than US counterparts and many have performed very well for us.
But the backdrop has been nothing short of grim. No tailwinds to be found. In 2014, when I
launched Alluvial Capital Management, the US stock market capitalization to GDP ratio was around
115%. Today it’s >200%. By contrast, the European Union’s 2014 ratio was around 55%. Is it not
substantially different in 2024. Not only has the European economy grown less quickly than the
USA’s, its companies remain modestly valued as a percentage of GDP while American companies
are more highly valued than ever before. Now, much of the gap is deserved. The American
economy is more vibrant, its workers more productive, and its companies more incentivized to
innovate and invest. Still, I am not convinced
these real advantages justify a valuation gap
TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 9/30/24 (%)
of this magnitude. At some point, unless

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Markets, or at least the NASDAQ, recovered a bit in the first quarter of 2023. The NASDAQ,
which had performed the worst in 2022, declining by 33%, bounced back the strongest, rising
by nearly 17% in the quarter. Cedar Creek increased by 6.4% in the first quarter, net of fees
and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/4 year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 909.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘23 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 6.4% 909.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 16.8% 427.5% 10.1%
DJIA (DIA) 0.9% 350.7% 9.1%
S&P 500 (SPY) 7.5% 344.9% 9.1%
Russell 2000 2.7% 220.9% 7.0%
Russell Microcap -2.8% 148.5% 5.4%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,009,166
as of March 31, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes
we compare against would have only grown to between $248,488 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $527,479 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).
Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.1
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 7.7 times
assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO
assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted
price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 2.4%. Weighted expected return on equity as of
March 31, 2023 was 26%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 6% and ended the quarter at 16%, due primarily to
capital inflows into the fund. We continued to add to PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). We initiated a new position in a community bank that
was not a recipient of funds through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It
trades on the expert market and was selling for about three times trailing earnings and half
of book value.
During the quarter we finished exiting our position in BM Technologies (BMTX). The poorly
named company was a poor investment. Maybe the first part of the name should have told
us it was going to be a turd. Anyways. It is always important to look at what mistake was
made in a poor performing investment. In this case, and it is embarrassing, we failed to truly
understand the industry and the company’s position. We know there are industries we don’t
understand as well as business models. When we encounter them, we have to either invest
the time to understand the industry and the specific business or move on.
BMTX presented itself as a fintech company on the cusp of a new wave in banking focused
on college students and white-label banking products for companies, such as T-Mobile (and
possible Google until that was canceled). The reality is that they are a middle man trying to
earn a spread on funds disbursed to college students and white label banking products. Our
zero-interest rate environment hid this. College students have small balances and T-Mobile
banking customers are interest rate sensitive so as rates rose, the spread BMTX could earn
shrunk. T Mobile money currently pays 2.5% on balances. BMTX was getting 3% from
Customers Bancorp, but it was not a market rate. They now get a floating rate closer to 4%.
But what once was a 3% interest spread when interest rates were zero, collapsed as rates
increased, and is now roughly half of that. Their profitability vanished quickly. Thankfully it
was a modest size position at roughly 3% of the fund and our overall loss was probably less
than 1% of assets.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased slightly in the quarter,
primarily due to capital inflows. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule
15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for
non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts,
depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter
with 29% exposure and ended at 27% of the fund.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We
project $0.22 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust.
Two positions make up about 60% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals
(PDRX), which is about 10% of the fund and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which is
roughly 6.5% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter
and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our
2022 yearend letter (link).
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank. Citizens has roughly 2
million shares outstanding. Shares ended the first quarter at $38.53 per share. The fund
started buying in June of last year at $12 per share, which was less half of common book
value, and six times 2021 earnings. We kept buying as it rose in price. Our basis is under
$19. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency
Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report
quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on
otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 had no unusual items and were
about $1.75 per share, giving an annualized rate of $7 per share. The sharp increase in
earnings was due to yields on their loan portfolio rising and having the ECIP funds invested
in US Treasuries yielding 4-5% during the quarter.
Assuming a $7 per share annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple to
earnings of around 6 times. Over time, the ECIP capital should move from being in 4% short-
term treasuries to being leveraged via growing deposits and loans or securities, which will
boost earnings further, or Citizens could use the funds to buy another bank and increase
earnings that way. Without an acquisition we think the bank can earn roughly $7 per share
this year despite rising deposit costs. The bank has also started expanding into Texas and
Tennessee so organic growth may kick in over the coming quarters. An acquisition would
likely speed that timetable up.
During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment by
TD Bank. The rate was only 1%, which was more favorable than the 2% we expected. In
February they increased their annual dividend from $0.50 to $0.75 per share. Citizens
released their annual report this past week which did contain a subsequent event that they
experienced the loss of their largest depositor, accounting for more than 5% of deposits. Due
to their significant cash holdings the loss is not a concern to the stability of the bank, but it
does dampen earnings growth in the near term. One bright spot was in their proxy statement,
which shareholders received, which showed a share count of 1,890,302 versus a year end
count of 1,981,259 (otcmarkets.com also shows 1,890,302 shares outstanding). This implies
a repurchase of approximately 5% of their outstanding shares in early April.
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares outstanding.
Last summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US Treasury’s ECIP. The
stock ended the first quarter at $22 per share. It had reached $30 prior to the bank selloff.
Our cost basis is under $12. M&F earned $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus
$0.51 per share in the third quarter. Most of the earnings increase was from ECIP funds
being moved into shorter term treasuries earning 4-5%. Annualizing fourth quarter earnings
gives a $3.25 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to have grown modestly in
the first quarter of 2023 due to some of their loan portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates
increasing due to the prime rate being higher) faster than their cost of deposits likely
increased.
A buyer today is paying 7 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double
from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making
loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient
banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 16% in the first quarter of
2023 from $8.70 per share to $10.10 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron
due to a proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting
was held in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related
to the U.S stockpile program, which noted.
In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.
Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and
to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending,
including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The increased
stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to add
approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024 and
running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract
awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024.
Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows
the significance of an expected $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted
Solitron’s cost savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end
of the fiscal second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1%
and 1.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were
recipients of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) share price was unchanged at $6 per share in the quarter.
As noted above, we continued to add to the position. It trades on the expert market. Since
the company only reports once a year there is nothing new to add. We think it is ridiculously
cheap. As of June 30, 2022 book value was $6.90 per share. Total cash and receivables less
all liabilities was $4.90 per share. Cash alone was $3.33 per share. Trailing earnings were
$1.84 per share. We are more than nine months into their fiscal 2023. If earnings are
running the same as in fiscal 2022, which we think is likely, then we can add $1.40 per share
to each of those metrics. At $6 we are likely paying 30% below book value, less than cash
and receivables minus all liabilities, nearly the same as cash on hand, and just over three
times earnings. Anytime an investor is paying below cash and receivables less all liabilities
you are getting the business for “free” which is absurd if the business is profitable today and
expected to be so into the future.
We would note that a company burning cash (i.e., experiencing operating losses) can easily
be worth less than its cash and receivables since it is likely it will continue to incur those
losses. That is why we are not comfortable with early-stage investments in money-losing
businesses.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units increased from $0.46 to $0.49 per unit. Due to the
stage we are in, in terms of calling a special meeting and filing proxy statements, we are not
going to discuss any details. We would refer you back to our prior letters regarding how view
the potential return.
Our investment in Tix Corporation (private) performed poorly in the quarter. As a reminder,
the company sells show tickets at four booths along the strip in Las Vegas. Sales in the first
quarter were well below expectations and the prior year period. This was very surprising to
us. We thought when shows re-opened in late 2021 and sales were a fraction of pre-COVID
levels that the trend would be upward, or at worst flat. Due to the decreased sales, we
decreased our valuation of Tix by more than 50% during the quarter. We are working
toward adding online sales in the latter half of the year. Online sales should have a different
profitability profile than the booths due to the absence of rent and most of the labor and
replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at the physical locations. It is
still too early to know whether the investment will turn around. Due to new funds coming in
and the decreased valuation, it is now only 2% of the fund’s assets.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.1
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 7.7 times
assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO
assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted
price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 2.4%. Weighted expected return on equity as of
March 31, 2023 was 26%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 6% and ended the quarter at 16%, due primarily to
capital inflows into the fund. We continued to add to PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). We initiated a new position in a community bank that
was not a recipient of funds through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It
trades on the expert market and was selling for about three times trailing earnings and half
of book value.
During the quarter we finished exiting our position in BM Technologies (BMTX). The poorly
named company was a poor investment. Maybe the first part of the name should have told
us it was going to be a turd. Anyways. It is always important to look at what mistake was
made in a poor performing investment. In this case, and it is embarrassing, we failed to truly
understand the industry and the company’s position. We know there are industries we don’t
understand as well as business models. When we encounter them, we have to either invest
the time to understand the industry and the specific business or move on.
BMTX presented itself as a fintech company on the cusp of a new wave in banking focused
on college students and white-label banking products for companies, such as T-Mobile (and
possible Google until that was canceled). The reality is that they are a middle man trying to
earn a spread on funds disbursed to college students and white label banking products. Our
zero-interest rate environment hid this. College students have small balances and T-Mobile
banking customers are interest rate sensitive so as rates rose, the spread BMTX could earn
shrunk. T Mobile money currently pays 2.5% on balances. BMTX was getting 3% from
Customers Bancorp, but it was not a market rate. They now get a floating rate closer to 4%.
But what once was a 3% interest spread when interest rates were zero, collapsed as rates
increased, and is now roughly half of that. Their profitability vanished quickly. Thankfully it
was a modest size position at roughly 3% of the fund and our overall loss was probably less
than 1% of assets.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased slightly in the quarter,
primarily due to capital inflows. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule
15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for
non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts,
depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter
with 29% exposure and ended at 27% of the fund.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We
project $0.22 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust.

Two positions make up about 60% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals
(PDRX), which is about 10% of the fund and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which is
roughly 6.5% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter
and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our
2022 yearend letter (link).
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank. Citizens has roughly 2
million shares outstanding. Shares ended the first quarter at $38.53 per share. The fund
started buying in June of last year at $12 per share, which was less half of common book
value, and six times 2021 earnings. We kept buying as it rose in price. Our basis is under
$19. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency
Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report
quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on
otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 had no unusual items and were
about $1.75 per share, giving an annualized rate of $7 per share. The sharp increase in
earnings was due to yields on their loan portfolio rising and having the ECIP funds invested
in US Treasuries yielding 4-5% during the quarter.
Assuming a $7 per share annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple to
earnings of around 6 times. Over time, the ECIP capital should move from being in 4% short-
term treasuries to being leveraged via growing deposits and loans or securities, which will
boost earnings further, or Citizens could use the funds to buy another bank and increase
earnings that way. Without an acquisition we think the bank can earn roughly $7 per share
this year despite rising deposit costs. The bank has also started expanding into Texas and
Tennessee so organic growth may kick in over the coming quarters. An acquisition would
likely speed that timetable up.
During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment by
TD Bank. The rate was only 1%, which was more favorable than the 2% we expected. In
February they increased their annual dividend from $0.50 to $0.75 per share. Citizens
released their annual report this past week which did contain a subsequent event that they
experienced the loss of their largest depositor, accounting for more than 5% of deposits. Due
to their significant cash holdings the loss is not a concern to the stability of the bank, but it
does dampen earnings growth in the near term. One bright spot was in their proxy statement,
which shareholders received, which showed a share count of 1,890,302 versus a year end
count of 1,981,259 (otcmarkets.com also shows 1,890,302 shares outstanding). This implies
a repurchase of approximately 5% of their outstanding shares in early April.
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares outstanding.
Last summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US Treasury’s ECIP. The
stock ended the first quarter at $22 per share. It had reached $30 prior to the bank selloff.
Our cost basis is under $12. M&F earned $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus
$0.51 per share in the third quarter. Most of the earnings increase was from ECIP funds
being moved into shorter term treasuries earning 4-5%. Annualizing fourth quarter earnings
gives a $3.25 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to have grown modestly in
the first quarter of 2023 due to some of their loan portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates
increasing due to the prime rate being higher) faster than their cost of deposits likely
increased.
A buyer today is paying 7 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double
from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making

loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient
banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 16% in the first quarter of
2023 from $8.70 per share to $10.10 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron
due to a proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting
was held in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related
to the U.S stockpile program, which noted.
In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.
Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and
to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending,
including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The increased
stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to add
approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024 and
running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract
awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024.
Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows
the significance of an expected $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted
Solitron’s cost savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end
of the fiscal second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1%
and 1.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were
recipients of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) share price was unchanged at $6 per share in the quarter.
As noted above, we continued to add to the position. It trades on the expert market. Since
the company only reports once a year there is nothing new to add. We think it is ridiculously
cheap. As of June 30, 2022 book value was $6.90 per share. Total cash and receivables less
all liabilities was $4.90 per share. Cash alone was $3.33 per share. Trailing earnings were
$1.84 per share. We are more than nine months into their fiscal 2023. If earnings are
running the same as in fiscal 2022, which we think is likely, then we can add $1.40 per share
to each of those metrics. At $6 we are likely paying 30% below book value, less than cash
and receivables minus all liabilities, nearly the same as cash on hand, and just over three
times earnings. Anytime an investor is paying below cash and receivables less all liabilities
you are getting the business for “free” which is absurd if the business is profitable today and
expected to be so into the future.
We would note that a company burning cash (i.e., experiencing operating losses) can easily
be worth less than its cash and receivables since it is likely it will continue to incur those
losses. That is why we are not comfortable with early-stage investments in money-losing
businesses.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units increased from $0.46 to $0.49 per unit. Due to the
stage we are in, in terms of calling a special meeting and filing proxy statements, we are not
going to discuss any details. We would refer you back to our prior letters regarding how view
the potential return.
Our investment in Tix Corporation (private) performed poorly in the quarter. As a reminder,
the company sells show tickets at four booths along the strip in Las Vegas. Sales in the first
quarter were well below expectations and the prior year period. This was very surprising to
us. We thought when shows re-opened in late 2021 and sales were a fraction of pre-COVID

levels that the trend would be upward, or at worst flat. Due to the decreased sales, we
decreased our valuation of Tix by more than 50% during the quarter. We are working
toward adding online sales in the latter half of the year. Online sales should have a different
profitability profile than the booths due to the absence of rent and most of the labor and
replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at the physical locations. It is
still too early to know whether the investment will turn around. Due to new funds coming in
and the decreased valuation, it is now only 2% of the fund’s assets.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022and 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates
based on the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by
the Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is
made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve
risk including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Markets, or at least the NASDAQ, recovered a bit in the first quarter of 2023. The NASDAQ,
which had performed the worst in 2022, declining by 33%, bounced back the strongest, rising
by nearly 17% in the quarter. Cedar Creek increased by 6.4% in the first quarter, net of fees
and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/4 year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 909.6%, net of fees and expenses.

running the same as in fiscal 2022, which we think is likely, then we can add $1.40 per share
to each of those metrics. At $6 we are likely paying 30% below book value, less than cash
and receivables minus all liabilities, nearly the same as cash on hand, and just over three
times earnings. Anytime an investor is paying below cash and receivables less all liabilities
you are getting the business for “free” which is absurd if the business is profitable today and
expected to be so into the future.
We would note that a company burning cash (i.e., experiencing operating losses) can easily
be worth less than its cash and receivables since it is likely it will continue to incur those
losses. That is why we are not comfortable with early-stage investments in money-losing
businesses.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units increased from $0.46 to $0.49 per unit. Due to the
stage we are in, in terms of calling a special meeting and filing proxy statements, we are not
going to discuss any details. We would refer you back to our prior letters regarding how view
the potential return.
Our investment in Tix Corporation (private) performed poorly in the quarter. As a reminder,
the company sells show tickets at four booths along the strip in Las Vegas. Sales in the first
quarter were well below expectations and the prior year period. This was very surprising to
us. We thought when shows re-opened in late 2021 and sales were a fraction of pre-COVID
levels that the trend would be upward, or at worst flat. Due to the decreased sales, we
decreased our valuation of Tix by more than 50% during the quarter. We are working
toward adding online sales in the latter half of the year. Online sales should have a different
profitability profile than the booths due to the absence of rent and most of the labor and
replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at the physical locations. It is
still too early to know whether the investment will turn around. Due to new funds coming in
and the decreased valuation, it is now only 2% of the fund’s assets.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Markets, or at least the NASDAQ, recovered a bit in the first quarter of 2023. The NASDAQ,
which had performed the worst in 2022, declining by 33%, bounced back the strongest, rising
by nearly 17% in the quarter. Cedar Creek increased by 6.4% in the first quarter, net of fees
and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 1/4 year history is 14.4%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 909.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q1 ‘23 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 6.4% 909.2% 14.4%
NASDAQ 16.8% 427.5% 10.1%
DJIA (DIA) 0.9% 350.7% 9.1%
S&P 500 (SPY) 7.5% 344.9% 9.1%
Russell 2000 2.7% 220.9% 7.0%
Russell Microcap -2.8% 148.5% 5.4%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,009,166
as of March 31, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes
we compare against would have only grown to between $248,488 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $527,479 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 5.1
times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4 times expected earnings
net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 7.7 times
assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), or 6.0 times assuming the ARO
assessment is improper and ROYTL should have earned $0.27 per unit in 2022. Weighted
price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 2.4%. Weighted expected return on equity as of
March 31, 2023 was 26%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the year with cash levels at 6% and ended the quarter at 16%, due primarily to
capital inflows into the fund. We continued to add to PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). We initiated a new position in a community bank that
was not a recipient of funds through the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). It
trades on the expert market and was selling for about three times trailing earnings and half
of book value.
During the quarter we finished exiting our position in BM Technologies (BMTX). The poorly
named company was a poor investment. Maybe the first part of the name should have told
us it was going to be a turd. Anyways. It is always important to look at what mistake was
made in a poor performing investment. In this case, and it is embarrassing, we failed to truly
understand the industry and the company’s position. We know there are industries we don’t
understand as well as business models. When we encounter them, we have to either invest
the time to understand the industry and the specific business or move on.
BMTX presented itself as a fintech company on the cusp of a new wave in banking focused
on college students and white-label banking products for companies, such as T-Mobile (and
possible Google until that was canceled). The reality is that they are a middle man trying to
earn a spread on funds disbursed to college students and white label banking products. Our
zero-interest rate environment hid this. College students have small balances and T-Mobile
banking customers are interest rate sensitive so as rates rose, the spread BMTX could earn
shrunk. T Mobile money currently pays 2.5% on balances. BMTX was getting 3% from
Customers Bancorp, but it was not a market rate. They now get a floating rate closer to 4%.
But what once was a 3% interest spread when interest rates were zero, collapsed as rates
increased, and is now roughly half of that. Their profitability vanished quickly. Thankfully it
was a modest size position at roughly 3% of the fund and our overall loss was probably less
than 1% of assets.
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased slightly in the quarter,
primarily due to capital inflows. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule
15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for
non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts,
depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter
with 29% exposure and ended at 27% of the fund.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We
project $0.22 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust.

Two positions make up about 60% of the expert market exposure – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals
(PDRX), which is about 10% of the fund and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), which is
roughly 6.5% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter
and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our
2022 yearend letter (link).
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank. Citizens has roughly 2
million shares outstanding. Shares ended the first quarter at $38.53 per share. The fund
started buying in June of last year at $12 per share, which was less half of common book
value, and six times 2021 earnings. We kept buying as it rose in price. Our basis is under
$19. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency
Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report
quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on
otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 had no unusual items and were
about $1.75 per share, giving an annualized rate of $7 per share. The sharp increase in
earnings was due to yields on their loan portfolio rising and having the ECIP funds invested
in US Treasuries yielding 4-5% during the quarter.
Assuming a $7 per share annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple to
earnings of around 6 times. Over time, the ECIP capital should move from being in 4% short-
term treasuries to being leveraged via growing deposits and loans or securities, which will
boost earnings further, or Citizens could use the funds to buy another bank and increase
earnings that way. Without an acquisition we think the bank can earn roughly $7 per share
this year despite rising deposit costs. The bank has also started expanding into Texas and
Tennessee so organic growth may kick in over the coming quarters. An acquisition would
likely speed that timetable up.
During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment by
TD Bank. The rate was only 1%, which was more favorable than the 2% we expected. In
February they increased their annual dividend from $0.50 to $0.75 per share. Citizens
released their annual report this past week which did contain a subsequent event that they
experienced the loss of their largest depositor, accounting for more than 5% of deposits. Due
to their significant cash holdings the loss is not a concern to the stability of the bank, but it
does dampen earnings growth in the near term. One bright spot was in their proxy statement,
which shareholders received, which showed a share count of 1,890,302 versus a year end
count of 1,981,259 (otcmarkets.com also shows 1,890,302 shares outstanding). This implies
a repurchase of approximately 5% of their outstanding shares in early April.
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares outstanding.
Last summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US Treasury’s ECIP. The
stock ended the first quarter at $22 per share. It had reached $30 prior to the bank selloff.
Our cost basis is under $12. M&F earned $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus
$0.51 per share in the third quarter. Most of the earnings increase was from ECIP funds
being moved into shorter term treasuries earning 4-5%. Annualizing fourth quarter earnings
gives a $3.25 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to have grown modestly in
the first quarter of 2023 due to some of their loan portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates
increasing due to the prime rate being higher) faster than their cost of deposits likely
increased.
A buyer today is paying 7 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double
from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making

loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient
banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 16% in the first quarter of
2023 from $8.70 per share to $10.10 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron
due to a proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting
was held in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related
to the U.S stockpile program, which noted.
In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.
Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and
to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending,
including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The increased
stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to add
approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024 and
running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract
awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024.
Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows
the significance of an expected $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted
Solitron’s cost savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end
of the fiscal second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1%
and 1.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were
recipients of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) share price was unchanged at $6 per share in the quarter.
As noted above, we continued to add to the position. It trades on the expert market. Since
the company only reports once a year there is nothing new to add. We think it is ridiculously
cheap. As of June 30, 2022 book value was $6.90 per share. Total cash and receivables less
all liabilities was $4.90 per share. Cash alone was $3.33 per share. Trailing earnings were
$1.84 per share. We are more than nine months into their fiscal 2023. If earnings are
running the same as in fiscal 2022, which we think is likely, then we can add $1.40 per share
to each of those metrics. At $6 we are likely paying 30% below book value, less than cash
and receivables minus all liabilities, nearly the same as cash on hand, and just over three
times earnings. Anytime an investor is paying below cash and receivables less all liabilities
you are getting the business for “free” which is absurd if the business is profitable today and
expected to be so into the future.
We would note that a company burning cash (i.e., experiencing operating losses) can easily
be worth less than its cash and receivables since it is likely it will continue to incur those
losses. That is why we are not comfortable with early-stage investments in money-losing
businesses.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units increased from $0.46 to $0.49 per unit. Due to the
stage we are in, in terms of calling a special meeting and filing proxy statements, we are not
going to discuss any details. We would refer you back to our prior letters regarding how view
the potential return.
Our investment in Tix Corporation (private) performed poorly in the quarter. As a reminder,
the company sells show tickets at four booths along the strip in Las Vegas. Sales in the first
quarter were well below expectations and the prior year period. This was very surprising to
us. We thought when shows re-opened in late 2021 and sales were a fraction of pre-COVID

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022and 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates
based on the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by
the Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is
made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve
risk including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.
Forward Looking Statements
This letter and the accompanying discussion include forward-looking statements. All statements that are

Letter to Limited Partners First Quarter 2023

The cover image shows the Mountain Laurel, the state flower of Pennsylvania whose beautiful (though poisonous!) blooms generally herald the arrival of summer in the eastern portion of the US. Though they have adapted to grow in a variety of climates, these flowers favor mountainous terrains, such as those found near Skytop Lodge, a new holding of Alluvial Fund. Read the letter for more information on this highland getaway located in the Pocono Mountains. Detroit Photographic Co. produced the image in the early 20th century using a technique invented in Switzerland called Photocrom, which generated realistic full color renditions from black and white photo negatives. Popularized by the company, this process was mainly used to create postcards bearing a color image—a wildly popular novelty at the turn of the century. Unfortunately, at about the same time that Skytop Lodge was being built in the 1920s, the successor company to Detroit Photographic Co. was forced into bankruptcy, a victim of changing tastes and newer printing technology.

Dear Partners, Alluvial Fund began the year on a positive note, rising 3.6%. By comparison, the Russell 2000 Index gained 2.7% and the Russell Micro-Cap Index fell by 2.8%. Looking at these figures, one might reasonably assume the market is having a quiet time, with little consequential news to trouble or excite investors. In fact, the market was rocked by a banking crisis that threatened to destabilize the financial sector and beyond before gradually dissipating. Small-cap indexes were up 10% at the end of January, only to give up those gains and then some in March before staging a recovery. In typical fashion, Alluvial Fund plotted a steadier course.

Despite this quarter’s gain, the gulf between our securities’ trading prices and their intrinsic values is as large as I have ever observed. Fourth quarter 2022 earnings were very good overall, but the market’s reaction to even the best news was muted. In response, I made some moves in our portfolio this quarter, selling out of one holding and adding a few others.

I sold all our shares of GEE Group this quarter. In my last letter, I mentioned how GEE Group’s place in our portfolio was dependent on management’s commitment to using the company’s balance sheet cash for the benefit of shareholders. Well, another quarter came and went with zero evidence that management’s promises and assurances were anything but empty words. Despite earlier proclamations of “good things” to come, the company formally dismissed the idea of returning cash to shareholders and again failed to deliver on long-promised profitable acquisitions. I am happy to put our capital to better use elsewhere, and to use our experience with GEE Group as a reminder that a lack of urgency and integrity on the part of company management can negate almost any degree of good economics or valuation.

In happier news, I have identified another opportunity in the Canadian industrial sector. Small Canadian manufacturers have become something of a theme for Alluvial, first with Supremex and now with our new holding Hammond Power Solutions. For decades, Hammond Power Solutions has been producing transformers, the boring, but utterly essential components responsible for transferring energy between circuits in electrical installations. Though they are one of the oldest examples of electrical technology, transformers are required by virtually anything that creates or employs electrical energy. The high quality, dry-type transformers produced by Hammond are widely used in factories and commercial buildings, power grids, and renewable energy facilities as well as oil & gas, mining, and many other industries. Demand for transformers has exploded as the electrification of the world economy accelerates. Despite running its factories at full capacity, Hammond has been unable to keep pace with inbound orders. The company plans to invest $40 million to increase its production capacity, as it expects demand for its products to remain strong in the coming years.

Hammond employs a conservative capital structure with zero debt and produces free cash flow like clockwork. There are few things I like more than finding a high-quality firm like Hammond trading at a pedestrian valuation. While Hammond shares have appreciated as the company’s revenues and profits grow, the market has yet to fairly credit the company for its growth profile and profitability.

Banking Brouhaha This year has been a rough one for many banks and bank stocks, as evidenced by the 25% drop in the S&P Regional Banking Index during the quarter. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as well as the ongoing precarious position of First Republic Bank and a few others, caused investors to question the safety and stability of nearly every American bank, no matter how sound. We are invested in a handful of banks, all recipients of low-cost permanent capital courtesy of the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program. While the goal of this program was to encourage lending in economically disadvantaged areas, it also happened to make its recipients some of the nation’s best-capitalized banks in terms of total equity to assets. For that reason, there is no cause for concern regarding the safety of any of the banks that Alluvial Fund holds. The market seems to agree as the share prices of our four banks fell just 1% on average this quarter.

Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

Each of our banks trades at a mid-single digit multiple of this year’s earnings and at a discount to economic book value, which I calculate by discounting the value of the ECIP capital infusion at market rates. I continue to believe that each bank will be valued at 2-3x current prices in a few years’ time. That is not to say our banks aren’t experiencing the same challenges as other banks. The interest rate environment is causing a steady increase in funding costs, and credit quality will come under some pressure if the economy slips into recession. But our banks are well-positioned to weather the storm. The American banking industry is divided into roughly three segments. There are gigantic national “too-big-to-fail” money center banks, regional banks, and community banks. Of these, I believe that regional banks have the toughest path forward. They don’t have the implicit government guarantee or national footprint that the giants have, nor can they build the personal relationships, local knowledge, and sticky deposit base that a good community bank can. There are plenty of reasons why a consumer or a business might choose a mega-bank or a micro-bank; I don’t see many reasons for choosing an unspecialized regional bank. I expect that large banks will be the major beneficiaries of deposits and lending relationships that leave regional banks, but I also expect community banks to capture a surprising amount. I also expect them to avoid some of the additional regulatory measures that are no doubt coming.

TABLE III: World Allocation, 3/31/23 (%) United States 72.3 Eurozone 11.6 Canada 7.8 Poland 5.0 Sweden 3.0 Other 0.3 Total 100% Other Portfolio Updates Our largest position remains P10 Inc., which reported another quarter of growth in assets under management, bringing the total to $21.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year. P10 shares are down year-to-date, no doubt reflecting investor pessimism around the fundraising environment for alternative asset managers. And yet, P10 just announced that its subsidiary RCP Advisors succeeded in raising $328 million for RCP XVII, exceeding the targeted $300 million. Despite the headwinds, P10’s managers are still attracting new capital. Though P10 has not found any suitable acquisitions of late, the company has found value in its own shares, repurchasing 1.6% of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter alone. The logic of these buybacks is unassailable; try as I might, I cannot find a better opportunity on a reward-per-unit-of-risk basis than P10 shares at under 12x perfectly visible, contractually guaranteed recurring free cash flow.

Unidata SpA remains a large holding and distinctly under-valued. Shares were pressured earlier this year by the company’s equity offering in support of its acquisition of TWT Group. Adding TWT will be tremendously accretive to Unidata’s earnings and cash flows, but the market is taking a “wait and see” approach. Unidata also announced it had signed a contract for the construction of its new undersea cable, which will be operational in two years’ time. Finally, Unidata has applied to uplist to the Borsa Italiana’s STAR segment, a more prominent segment with higher listing standards that should bring additional attention to the company and its shares.

The other day, an anonymous Twitter friend shared the picture below from Rome. This isn’t just some nondescript metal hatch, it’s Unidata’s (and by extension, our) nondescript metal hatch! I always appreciate a reminder that the stocks and securities we invest in are far more than figures on a screen, they’re ownership in and obligations of organizations run by and employing real people, with real assets, doing (hopefully!) profitable things in the world. And these things take time. While Unidata shares have disappointed lately, our investment has been an extraordinary success over our period of ownership. Unidata’s revenues and earnings will continue to grow rapidly as the company brings broadband internet to thousands of businesses and households, many for the first time. In due time the market will realize the essential and irreplaceable infrastructure that Unidata builds and owns is worth more than 7x 2025 normalized free cash flow it fetches today.

I must take a second to recognize EACO Corp., which has quietly become a significant holding for Alluvial Fund. I last mentioned the company almost three years ago when shares were trading around $19. The company was valued around $100 million and had produced operating income of $12.3 million in the trailing year. Today, EACO shares change hands in the low $30s. The company is valued at $140 million and produced operating income of $28 million for the year ended February 28, 2023. Impressive, and still extremely cheap. It’s likely that EACO’s results will moderate. COVID-related supply chain issues resulted in improved margins for companies like EACO and their Bisco Industries subsidiary. But even if operating margins were to recede to 2019 levels, EACO shares would be trading at 9x normalized earnings net of cash and securities. I expect EACO’s revenue growth to continue at a mid-teens pace. The basic electrical components and fasteners that Bisco Industries distributes are in high demand. The company is rising to the occasion, today employing 370 sales employees, 9.5% more than a year ago.

TIM SA, a member of our basket of Polish stocks, received a takeover offer in late March, causing shares to jump 28%. I sold our holdings in the following days. Our investment in TIM was successful but alas, too brief. I had hoped to hold our shares for quite some time and to sell them years down the road at a significantly higher price. However, I cannot blame management for wishing to engineer a fair outcome for shareholders when the market stubbornly refused to recognize TIM’s progress. I am working to invest the proceeds of our TIM SA investment into other Polish securities, which offer some of the world’s best valuations. Other stocks in the Polish basket include Hortico SA, a growing gardening supplier trading at <4x earnings; Auto Partner SA, a high-quality auto parts distributor growing at 30% but trading at 12x earnings; and a new holding in a software company that grew 90% in 2022 but trades at <8x normalized cash flow. Our Polish holdings have been strong contributors to Alluvial Fund since we began investing in Poland in 2019. It’s a volatile market and prone to long periods where the general market mood overshadows individual company results, but buying quality holdings at great prices works, given enough time.

“One Day” Stocks I have written before about the concept of “one day” stocks. These are stocks and securities that are so obscure, off-the-run, and/or illiquid that they are unlikely to approach their fair value in the short run, but nevertheless offer incredible value that will accrue to investors “one day”–and sometimes in literally one day-as the result of a buyout or merger, a balance sheet recapitalization, or some other catalyzing transaction. It’s never wise to put too much of one’s portfolio in any one of these securities, because “one day” could be a decade off. Still, a diverse basket of these securities offers attractive upside. I recently found a new addition for our “one day” collection. Skytop Lodge is an historic Poconos hotel and resort, operating since 1928. The property includes 124 guest rooms and 5,500 acres of private woodlands, a lake, and a golf course. While Skytop’s fortunes and those of the greater Poconos region have risen and fallen over time, the company’s financials have improved significantly in recent years. Skytop has operated profitably, paid down debt, and performed major upgrades to its property, offering improved amenities and bettering the guest experience. Skytop is never going to appeal to travelers seeking the height of luxury and sophistication, but it does have a loyal base of vacationers who appreciate the seclusion and natural beauty of the property and the surrounding area. The reviews are in and they are good!

Alluvial Fund has purchased just over 2% of Skytop Lodge Corp. On a look-through basis, we own 2.5 guest rooms and 112 acres of pristine forest. From a purely financial perspective, we invested at <6x normalized earnings and cash flows, a 27% cap rate, and at $82,000 per key, land value excluded. Using a very conservative 12.5% cap rate on the property’s cash earnings and adjusting for some corporate overhead, I think Skytop shares would be worth at least $2,300 per share in a sale transaction. I have no idea when or if that transaction will occur, but I am happy to hold a stake in a cash-flowing enterprise where value will continue to accrue with each passing year. I have yet to visit Skytop, but I hope to make the trip later this year with my family. Until then, I’ll just keep checking out their webcam and gallery.

Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

Special Situations I continue to seek out special situations that offer mid-teens or higher rates of return without meaningful market risks. Thus far in 2023, we have benefitted from two liquidating biotech companies, Otonomy Inc. and Sio Gene Therapies. We purchased our Otonomy shares at an average cost of $0.116, and have already received an initial liquidating distribution of $0.11 per share, with the potential for up to 2 additional cents per share as outstanding claims and contingencies are resolved. We purchased our shares of Sio Gene Therapies at an average of $0.414 per share. The company will soon distribute 38-42 cents per share and shareholders may receive additional value of as much as 9 cents per share in the course of the liquidation. In both cases, we will have received >90% of our initial investment in just a few weeks or months, setting up an attractive rate of return as additional liquidation proceeds are received.

Our largest liquidation investment, Retail Value Inc., is proceeding well. In early April, we received $0.17 per share, meaning we have now received liquidating distributions in excess of the cost of some of our earlier purchases. I expect us to receive additional distributions totaling around 14 cents per share in coming years. Retail Value shares have been converted to interests in a liquidating trust and no longer trade. We are invested in a few other liquidation scenarios that offer similar return profiles, but are too illiquid to mention for now. As attractive as liquidation scenarios can be, they are not the only type of special situations I seek for Alluvial Fund. Just last week we took advantage of a fast-moving special situation involving the direct listing of a former private REIT.

Private REITs, real estate-owning trusts that do not trade on a public exchange, are rightly regarded as slimy. They nearly always feature egregious insider compensation, unsustainable distribution policies, and badly-designed incentive structures. They are also highly illiquid. Much like a timeshare, a private REIT is easy to acquire but nearly impossible to sell. Because their performance is bad on average, most Private REITs have a long list of holders eager to exit. But there are few buyers, and none willing to pay anywhere close to the REIT’s self-reported net asset value. Enter Peakstone Realty Trust. Founded as Griffin Realty Trust, this private REIT underwent a series of mergers and transactions in recent years and internalized its management, but still found itself unable to grow its net asset value. Peakstone considered liquidating, but ultimately decided to continue and to list its shares on the NYSE. And so, with little fanfare, Peakstone Realty Trust shares became publicly tradable. What happens when a highly illiquid asset with thousands of “trapped” holders suddenly becomes tradable? An avalanche of selling overwhelms the market. Peakstone shares held by the transfer agent, Computershare, were sold into the market by the millions without regard for price. Peakstone’s self-calculated net asset value per share was $67 as of June 30, but shares traded as low as $8 on the first day of trading! I recognized the imbalance and was able to accumulate shares at high teens prices. The selling pressure abated in the following days, and shares rose to more reasonable levels in the high $30s and low $40s, where we took profits and moved on. Situations where a short-term imbalance between buyers and sellers causes prices to diverge wildly from fair value can be highly lucrative, but they don’t often occur. I am keeping my eyes open for the next to come along.

Letter to Limited Partners First Quarter 2023

The cover image shows the Mountain Laurel, the state flower of Pennsylvania
whose beautiful (though poisonous!) blooms generally herald the arrival of
summer in the eastern portion of the US. Though they have adapted to grow
in a variety of climates, these flowers favor mountainous terrains, such as those
found near Skytop Lodge, a new holding of Alluvial Fund. Read the letter for
more information on this highland getaway located in the Pocono Mountains.
Detroit Photographic Co. produced the image in the early 20th century using a
technique invented in Switzerland called Photocrom, which generated realistic
full color renditions from black and white photo negatives. Popularized by the
company, this process was mainly used to create postcards bearing a color
image—a wildly popular novelty at the turn of the century. Unfortunately,
at about the same time that Skytop Lodge was being built in the 1920s, the
successor company to Detroit Photographic Co. was forced into bankruptcy, a
victim of changing tastes and newer printing technology.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund began the year on a positive note, rising 3.6%. By comparison, the Russell 2000
Index gained 2.7% and the Russell Micro-Cap Index fell by 2.8%. Looking at these figures, one
might reasonably assume the market is having a quiet time, with little consequential news to
trouble or excite investors. In fact, the market was rocked by a banking crisis that threatened to
destabilize the financial sector and beyond before gradually dissipating. Small-cap indexes were
up 10% at the end of January, only to give up those gains and then some in March before staging
a recovery. In typical fashion, Alluvial Fund plotted a steadier course.

Small company shares remain out-of-favor compared to those of large companies. Despite this
quarter’s gain, the gulf between our securities’ trading prices and their intrinsic values is as large
as I have ever observed. Fourth quarter 2022 earnings were very good overall, but the market’s
reaction to even the best news was muted. In response, I made some moves in our portfolio this
quarter, selling out of one holding and adding a few others.
I sold all our shares of GEE Group this quarter. In my last letter, I mentioned how GEE Group’s
place in our portfolio was dependent on management’s commitment to using the company’s
balance sheet cash for the benefit of shareholders. Well, another quarter came and went with zero
evidence that management’s promises and assurances were anything but empty words. Despite
earlier proclamations of “good things” to come, the company formally dismissed the idea of
returning cash to shareholders and again failed to deliver on long-promised profitable acquisitions.
I am happy to put our capital to better use elsewhere, and to use our experience with GEE Group
as a reminder that a lack of urgency and integrity on the part of company management can negate
almost any degree of good economics or valuation.

In happier news, I have identified another opportunity in the Canadian industrial sector. Small
Canadian manufacturers have become something of a theme for Alluvial, first with Supremex and
now with our new holding Hammond Power Solutions. For decades, Hammond Power Solutions
has been producing transformers, the boring, but utterly essential components responsible for
transferring energy between circuits in electrical installations. Though they are one of the oldest
examples of electrical technology, transformers are required by virtually anything that creates or
employs electrical energy. The high quality, dry-type transformers produced by Hammond are
widely used in factories and commercial buildings, power grids, and renewable energy facilities
as well as oil & gas, mining, and many other
industries. Demand for transformers has

I like more than finding a high-quality firm like Hammond trading at a pedestrian valuation. While
Hammond shares have appreciated as the company’s revenues and profits grow, the market has
yet to fairly credit the company for its growth profile and profitability.
Banking Brouhaha
This year has been a rough one for many banks and bank stocks, as evidenced by the 25% drop
in the S&P Regional Banking Index during the quarter. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and
Signature Bank, as well as the ongoing precarious position of First Republic Bank and a few others,
caused investors to question the safety and stability of nearly every American bank, no matter how
sound.
We are invested in a handful of banks, all recipients of low-cost permanent capital courtesy of
the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program. While the goal of this program was to
encourage lending in economically disadvantaged areas, it also happened to make its recipients
some of the nation’s best-capitalized banks in terms of total equity to assets. For that reason,
there is no cause for concern regarding the safety of any of the banks that Alluvial Fund holds. The
market seems to agree as the share prices of our four banks fell just 1% on average this quarter.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

Each of our banks trades at a mid-single digit multiple of this year’s earnings and at a discount
to economic book value, which I calculate by discounting the value of the ECIP capital infusion
at market rates. I continue to believe that each bank will be valued at 2-3x current prices in a few
years’ time.
That is not to say our banks aren’t experiencing the same challenges as other banks. The interest
rate environment is causing a steady increase in funding costs, and credit quality will come under
some pressure if the economy slips into recession. But our banks are well-positioned to weather
the storm. The American banking industry is divided into roughly three segments. There are
gigantic national “too-big-to-fail” money center banks, regional banks, and community banks. Of
these, I believe that regional banks have the toughest path forward. They don’t have the implicit
government guarantee or national footprint that the giants have, nor can they build the personal
relationships, local knowledge, and sticky deposit base that a good community bank can. There
are plenty of reasons why a consumer or a business might choose a mega-bank or a micro-bank;
I don’t see many reasons for choosing an
unspecialized regional bank. I expect that
TABLE III: World Allocation, 3/31/23 (%)
large banks will be the major beneficiaries of
United States 72.3
deposits and lending relationships that leave
regional banks, but I also expect community Eurozone 11.6
banks to capture a surprising amount. I also
Canada 7.8
expect them to avoid some of the additional
regulatory measures that are no doubt Poland 5.0
coming.
Sweden 3.0
Other Portfolio Updates Other 0.3
Our largest position remains P10 Inc.,
Total 100%
which reported another quarter of growth
in assets under management, bringing
the total to $21.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year. P10 shares are down year-to-date, no doubt
reflecting investor pessimism around the fundraising environment for alternative asset managers.
And yet, P10 just announced that its subsidiary RCP Advisors succeeded in raising $328 million for
RCP XVII, exceeding the targeted $300 million. Despite the headwinds, P10’s managers are still
attracting new capital. Though P10 has not found any suitable acquisitions of late, the company
has found value in its own shares, repurchasing 1.6% of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter
alone. The logic of these buybacks is unassailable; try as I might, I cannot find a better opportunity
on a reward-per-unit-of-risk basis than P10 shares at under 12x perfectly visible, contractually
guaranteed recurring free cash flow.
Unidata SpA remains a large holding and distinctly under-valued. Shares were pressured earlier
this year by the company’s equity offering in support of its acquisition of TWT Group. Adding TWT
will be tremendously accretive to Unidata’s earnings and cash flows, but the market is taking a
“wait and see” approach. Unidata also announced it had signed a contract for the construction of
its new undersea cable, which will be operational in two years’ time. Finally, Unidata has applied
to uplist to the Borsa Italiana’s STAR segment, a more prominent segment with higher listing
standards that should bring additional attention to the company and its shares.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

The other day, an anonymous Twitter friend shared the picture below from Rome. This isn’t just
some nondescript metal hatch, it’s Unidata’s (and by extension, our) nondescript metal hatch!
I always appreciate a reminder that the stocks and securities we invest in are far more than
figures on a screen, they’re ownership in and obligations of organizations run by and employing
real people, with real assets, doing (hopefully!) profitable things in the world. And these things
take time. While Unidata shares have
disappointed lately, our investment has been
an extraordinary success over our period of
ownership. Unidata’s revenues and earnings
will continue to grow rapidly as the company
brings broadband internet to thousands of
businesses and households, many for the first
time. In due time the market will realize the
essential and irreplaceable infrastructure that
Unidata builds and owns is worth more than
7x 2025 normalized free cash flow it fetches
today.
I must take a second to recognize EACO
Corp., which has quietly become a significant
holding for Alluvial Fund. I last mentioned the
company almost three years ago when shares
were trading around $19. The company was
valued around $100 million and had produced
operating income of $12.3 million in the
trailing year. Today, EACO shares change PHOTO — Meanwhile in Rome
hands in the low $30s. The company is valued
at $140 million and produced operating income of $28 million for the year ended February 28,
2023. Impressive, and still extremely cheap. It’s likely that EACO’s results will moderate. COVID-
related supply chain issues resulted in improved margins for companies like EACO and their Bisco
Industries subsidiary. But even if operating margins were to recede to 2019 levels, EACO shares
would be trading at 9x normalized earnings net of cash and securities. I expect EACO’s revenue
growth to continue at a mid-teens pace. The basic electrical components and fasteners that Bisco
Industries distributes are in high demand. The company is rising to the occasion, today employing
370 sales employees, 9.5% more than a year ago.
TIM SA, a member of our basket of Polish stocks, received a takeover offer in late March,
causing shares to jump 28%. I sold our holdings in the following days. Our investment in TIM
was successful but alas, too brief. I had hoped to hold our shares for quite some time and to sell
them years down the road at a significantly higher price. However, I cannot blame management
for wishing to engineer a fair outcome for shareholders when the market stubbornly refused to
recognize TIM’s progress. I am working to invest the proceeds of our TIM SA investment into
other Polish securities, which offer some of the world’s best valuations. Other stocks in the Polish
basket include Hortico SA, a growing gardening supplier trading at <4x earnings; Auto Partner
SA, a high-quality auto parts distributor growing at 30% but trading at 12x earnings; and a new
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

holding in a software company that grew 90% in 2022 but trades at <8x normalized cash flow.
Our Polish holdings have been strong contributors to Alluvial Fund since we began investing in
Poland in 2019. It’s a volatile market and prone to long periods where the general market mood
overshadows individual company results, but buying quality holdings at great prices works, given
enough time.
“One Day” Stocks
I have written before about the concept of “one day” stocks. These are stocks and securities that
are so obscure, off-the-run, and/or illiquid that they are unlikely to approach their fair value in
the short run, but nevertheless offer incredible value that will accrue to investors “one day”–and
sometimes in literally one day-as the result of a buyout or merger, a balance sheet recapitalization,
or some other catalyzing transaction. It’s never wise to put too much of one’s portfolio in any
one of these securities, because “one day” could be a decade off. Still, a diverse basket of these
securities offers attractive upside. I recently found a new addition for our “one day” collection.
Skytop Lodge is an historic Poconos hotel and resort, operating since 1928. The property includes
124 guest rooms and 5,500 acres of private woodlands, a lake, and a golf course. While Skytop’s
fortunes and those of the greater Poconos region have risen and fallen over time, the company’s
financials have improved significantly in recent years. Skytop has operated profitably, paid down
debt, and performed major upgrades to its
property, offering improved amenities and
bettering the guest experience. Skytop is never
going to appeal to travelers seeking the height
of luxury and sophistication, but it does have
a loyal base of vacationers who appreciate the
seclusion and natural beauty of the property
and the surrounding area. The reviews are in
and they are good!
Alluvial Fund has purchased just over 2%
of Skytop Lodge Corp. On a look-through
basis, we own 2.5 guest rooms and 112 acres
of pristine forest. From a purely financial
perspective, we invested at <6x normalized
earnings and cash flows, a 27% cap rate, and at
$82,000 per key, land value excluded. Using a PHOTO — Skytop Lodge
very conservative 12.5% cap rate on the property’s
cash earnings and adjusting for some corporate overhead, I think Skytop shares would be worth
at least $2,300 per share in a sale transaction. I have no idea when or if that transaction will occur,
but I am happy to hold a stake in a cash-flowing enterprise where value will continue to accrue
with each passing year. I have yet to visit Skytop, but I hope to make the trip later this year with my
family. Until then, I’ll just keep checking out their webcam and gallery.

Special Situations
I continue to seek out special situations that offer mid-teens or higher rates of return without
meaningful market risks. Thus far in 2023, we have benefitted from two liquidating biotech
companies, Otonomy Inc. and Sio Gene Therapies. We purchased our Otonomy shares at an
average cost of $0.116, and have already received an initial liquidating distribution of $0.11
per share, with the potential for up to 2 additional cents per share as outstanding claims and
contingencies are resolved. We purchased our shares of Sio Gene Therapies at an average of
$0.414 per share. The company will soon distribute 38-42 cents per share and shareholders may
receive additional value of as much as 9 cents per share in the course of the liquidation. In both
cases, we will have received >90% of our initial investment in just a few weeks or months, setting
up an attractive rate of return as additional liquidation proceeds are received.
Our largest liquidation investment, Retail Value Inc., is proceeding well. In early April, we received
$0.17 per share, meaning we have now received liquidating distributions in excess of the cost
of some of our earlier purchases. I expect us to receive additional distributions totaling around
14 cents per share in coming years. Retail Value shares have been converted to interests in a
liquidating trust and no longer trade.
We are invested in a few other liquidation scenarios that offer similar return profiles, but are too
illiquid to mention for now. As attractive as liquidation scenarios can be, they are not the only type
of special situations I seek for Alluvial Fund. Just last week we took advantage of a fast-moving
special situation involving the direct listing of a former private REIT.
Private REITs, real estate-owning trusts that do not trade on a public exchange, are rightly
regarded as slimy. They nearly always feature egregious insider compensation, unsustainable
distribution policies, and badly-designed incentive structures. They are also highly illiquid. Much
like a timeshare, a private REIT is easy to acquire but nearly impossible to sell. Because their
performance is bad on average, most Private REITs have a long list of holders eager to exit. But
there are few buyers, and none willing to pay anywhere close to the REIT’s self-reported net asset
value. Enter Peakstone Realty Trust. Founded as Griffin Realty Trust, this private REIT underwent a
series of mergers and transactions in recent years and internalized its management, but still found
itself unable to grow its net asset value. Peakstone considered liquidating, but ultimately decided
to continue and to list its shares on the NYSE. And so, with little fanfare, Peakstone Realty Trust
shares became publicly tradable. What happens when a highly illiquid asset with thousands of
“trapped” holders suddenly becomes tradable? An avalanche of selling overwhelms the market.
Peakstone shares held by the transfer agent, Computershare, were sold into the market by the
millions without regard for price. Peakstone’s self-calculated net asset value per share was $67 as of
June 30, but shares traded as low as $8 on the first day of trading! I recognized the imbalance and
was able to accumulate shares at high teens prices. The selling pressure abated in the following
days, and shares rose to more reasonable levels in the high $30s and low $40s, where we took
profits and moved on.
Situations where a short-term imbalance between buyers and sellers causes prices to diverge wildly
from fair value can be highly lucrative, but they don’t often occur. I am keeping my eyes open for
the next to come along.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund enjoyed a strong start to the year, gaining 6.5%. This is particularly notable given
the dismal backdrop, especially for small domestic stocks. The Russell 2000 Index returned -9.5%,
while the Russell Microcap Index fell -14.4%. All told, Alluvial Fund enjoyed one of the best
quarters in our history versus relevant benchmarks. Our performance was driven by upward moves
in our two core London-listed holdings, while stock indexes declined on worries about tariffs and
declining business and consumer confidence.

The wild ride seems set to continue. The market plunges and roars in turn as tariffs are announced,
seemingly without thought or strategy, then just as thoughtlessly scaled back or abandoned. I
won’t comment on the current levels or structure of these tariffs, because my thoughts are sure to
be made irrelevant by week’s end. I will say with confidence that this chaotic approach is toxic to
the business environment. What business can make strategic decisions when the rules of the game
change by the week or even by the day? Many will opt to minimize discretionary spending and
investment until a more stable environment prevails, with consequences to all aspects of economic
activity.
Alluvial Fund’s direct exposure to these tariffs is low. In a time of rising US-driven economic
isolationism, the sophisticated global supply chains built by large companies are becoming
something of a liability. Little of what our companies buy and sell ever crosses a US border.
Some companies have no US presence and use little or no US products in their supply chain, like
Bahnhof AB and We Connect SA. Our real estate companies are immune, obviously, at least until
the executive figures out how to tariff an immovable object. Some of our companies, like Garrett
Motion and FitLife Brands, will experience challenges if tariffs on the European Union and China
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

are not reduced and resolved. But each company has the resources to adjust its supply chain and
selling strategies to mitigate the effects. Poor Garrett Motion has faced a nearly unending series
of economic adversities since exiting bankruptcy in 2021 but has still managed to reduce its share
count by one-third since. Tariffs are just another bump in the road.
As I write, US stock indexes have continued their downward trend, with the Russell 2000 Index now
sitting at a total return of -15% year-to-date. I am happy to report that in typical fashion, Alluvial
Fund is holding up well, down less than 1% this month. After years of frustrating experiences
investing outside the United States,
international equities have delivered so far
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 3/31/25 (%)
this year, much to our benefit. Whether or not
Zegona Communications plc. 12.0
this trend will continue, I cannot say. But I do
believe that if US stocks continue to face risks Net Lease Office Properties 9.4
from constantly shifting trade policy, many

investors will give serious consideration to
other markets. Fitlife Brands Inc. 4.2

This year’s best performer has been Crawford United Corp. 4.1
Zegona Communications. Zegona acquired

And second, to de-lever the balance sheet
Total, Top Ten 54.9%
by selling Vodafone Spain’s prime fiber-optic
network assets. Management has made great
strides toward each objective, and the market has noticed. I expect the sale of Vodafone Spain’s
fiber assets to close in the next few months, which will transform the company’s balance sheet and
allow for a return of capital to investors. Despite the strong move in Zegona’s share price, shares
are still attractively priced.
Our other UK-listed company, McBride Plc, has also been a strong contributor this year. The
company reported excellent 2024 results, with continued strong earnings and a bright outlook.
Even so, shares trade at only 6x operating income and less than 6x normalized earnings, far too
cheap for a defensive company selling soaps and detergents. A large US university’s endowment
is McBride’s third-largest shareholder, and the endowment has been steadily selling down its
position. I believe this selling activity is keeping a lid on McBride’s share price, and that shares will
respond once the endowment’s selling activity abates. McBride intends to reinitiate its dividend
later this year. UK Retail investors (“punters,” in the lingo) love a dividend, so the move could raise
McBride’s profile.

Limestone, Clay, and Some Other Stuff
Take limestone and clay, grind them, toss in a few other chemical ingredients, fire the mix at high
temperatures and you have cement. Cement is, after water, the most used material on earth. The
cement industry has been a major contributor to Alluvial’s recent returns. We own four different
cement producers, each operating in different regions. Our largest cement industry holdings are
Titan Cement SA and The Monarch Cement Company. Monarch has quietly become a top ten
holding for the fund after delivering solid
2024 results. Titan Cement successfully
listed its American operations on the NYSE TABLE III: World Allocation, 3/31/25 (%)
as “Titan America SA” and plans to return
United States 59.8
most of the proceeds from the listing as a
United Kingdom 20.7
special dividend. While the valuations of both
Monarch and Titan have moved up, each still
Eurozone 11.5
trades at a substantial discount to fair value.
Poland 4.0
I don’t expect either company to sell more
cement this year than it did last year, but Sweden 1.9
pricing actions, such as the 8% price increase
Denmark 1.3
pushed through by Monarch in January,
should have a positive impact on revenues. Other 0.8
Total 100%
A weakening economy would be a headwind
for cement companies, as construction activity
is a major driver of demand for cement. However, I believe that cement companies will continue
to enjoy good pricing power and utilization for years to come thanks to underinvestment in
production in the years following the Financial Crisis.
A Price For Every Asset
Homebuyers are often advised that buying “the worst house in the best neighborhood” is a solid
approach. When it comes to investing, I have had much better luck doing the opposite. Through
the years, Alluvial Fund has done well in buying deeply discounted real estate in struggling
sectors of the real estate market. Buying fundamentally sound property portfolios and waiting for
sentiment to improve fits our long-term approach and willingness to own unpopular assets. We
bought Scandinavian hotels coming out of the COVID downturn, and US office properties just
when “work from home” was at its peak. Each worked quite well.
The real estate companies in our portfolio continue to execute well in the face of continued
pessimism and neglect. Net Lease Office Properties is marketing multiple buildings for sale,
including the iconic “Binoculars Building” in Los Angeles, which is leased to Google through
2030. Net Lease will soon be able to begin distributing cash to shareholders, having paid down
nearly all recourse debt through property sales. Unlike Net Lease, which is pursuing a liquidation
strategy, Peakstone Realty is seeking to reduce the stigma of office ownership by diversifying into
niche industrial properties. The market has yet to give them credit for selling off lower-quality office
buildings and buying industrial outdoor storage assets, but I expect the market to reassess once
industrial properties account for more than 50% of rents and net operating income. Malls may be
even more out of favor than offices, but mall owner CBL properties is improving its portfolio and
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q1 2025 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

reducing risk by selling marginal assets, paying down debt, and reinvesting in its strongest and
healthiest mall properties. Net Lease shares change hands at a 38% discount to my estimate of
net asset value. Both Peakstone and CBL properties offer cash flow yields north of 20%. In recent
weeks, the rising 10-year yield has put pressure on the real estate sector. This is a real issue for
the folks who bought apartment buildings at 5% cash flow yields, but merely an annoyance for us.
The high cash flow yield offered by our real estate holdings reduces the impact the interest rate
changes have on their value.
My willingness to invest in out-of-favor sectors and situations is built on a belief that every asset
has its price. Definitionally, the value of an asset has a zero bound. So, even the most distressed
company facing the biggest obstacles and
uncertainties can be an opportunity at some

in time, I would skip owning BankFirst shares and instead buy more United Bancorporation of
Alabama, a strong performer that remains part of our portfolio.
Updates and Closing
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC has reached a major milestone, achieving assets under
management of $100 million. Not bad for a firm that was launched with little more than a laptop
computer and my obsessive interest in obscure securities. When I met my now-wife, Kayleigh,
in 2012, I said something to the effect of “I work at a bank, but what I really want to do is read
company reports all day and listen to music.” And now, I do. Life is good.
Thank you for the opportunity for the opportunity to manage a portion of your hard-earned money.
It is a responsibility I take very seriously, not least because the entirety of my family’s investments is
invested in Alluvial’s strategies.

Third Point Offshore Fund,Daniel S. Loeb,"February 4, 2025",2024.0,4.0,9.1,S&P 500,2.4,6.699999999999999,"The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Master Fund LP in a master-feeder structure. Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Master Fund LP inclusive of legacy private investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable. Sector and geographic categories are determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices.

For the year 2024, Third Point returned 24.2% in the flagship Offshore Fund. 1 Through December 31, 2024. 2 Annualized Return from inception (December 1996 for TP Offshore and quoted indices). PLEASE SEE THE NEW SERIES RETURNS AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT. The top five winners for the quarter were Siemens Energy AG, Amazon.com Inc., Tesla Inc., LPL Financial Holdings Inc., and Apollo Global Management Inc. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding hedges, were Danaher Corp., Glencore PLC, Ferguson Enterprises Inc., Intercontinental Exchange Inc., and a short position. Third Point’s flagship Offshore Fund generated net returns of 9.1% in the fourth quarter, and 24.2% for the full year1. These returns were driven by positive results across all strategies – equities, corporate and structured credit, and privates. Throughout the year, we 1 This letter includes discussions of certain portfolio investments. These discussions are intended to provide information concerning such investments and to illustrate Third Point’s investment analyses, but they are not necessarily representative of Third Point investments generally or of the overall performance of funds managed by Third Point. Please see page 1 of this letter for overall performance of funds managed by Third Point implementing the flagship strategy for the most recent quarter and since inception. Page 1 highlighted our diversified portfolio of equity investments, some with event-driven catalysts, others with quality characteristics, and several idiosyncratic themes that differentiated our return makeup from the S&P. As market returns broadened during the second half of the year, we believe we were well positioned to take advantage. In our view, successful portfolio rotation into consumer discretionary, financials and industrial names helped us capture the upside of the post-election rally we predicted in our Q3 letter. This positioning drove our Q4 equity RoA to 10.7% gross (10.1% net), outperforming the S&P 500’s +2.4% and MSCI World’s -0.1%. Outlook Since the November election, we have observed economics and policy becoming increasingly intertwined. Although business leaders are generally optimistic about economic growth and reduced bureaucracy and regulation, uncertainty around certain policies and strategies remains. In our view, it has never been more important to employ second-order thinking about news headlines in general, and certain policy declarations in particular. In the past week, DeepSeek, the Chinese LLM application, caused a panic in technology markets, calling into question everything from the future demand for Nvidia chips to power demand for data centers. Initial reports that the app was built on open-source data on antiquated chips by moonlighting hedge fund quants were subsequently debunked. This is not to say that DeepSeek is not a stunning breakthrough, but we believe the initial reaction seems to have been overdone. We believe there are many companies such as Meta and others that will likely benefit from the technology. Similarly, as we saw, the Administration’s recently announced tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China will be less impactful than the headlines currently implied; we see more modest tariffs, implemented by the Treasury and Commerce departments, early this spring. Overall, we expect the environment for investing in equities to continue to be favorable, with the caveat that there will likely be periodic dislocations caused by the unconventional approach of this Administration in conveying and enacting policy that affects markets and the economy. In this environment, we believe an unemotional response, independent of one’s political views, is critical to making good investment decisions. We remain optimistic Page 2 about the sectors that will benefit from certain of these policies, as well as an increase in M&A and other corporate activity which feeds our event-driven framework. New Equity Positions Brookfield Corp. Last summer we initiated a position in Brookfield Corp. Brookfield is one of the largest global alternative asset managers with over $500 billion in fee-earning AUM. We believe Brookfield is uniquely positioned to be a beneficiary of the secular growth tailwinds around infrastructure, where it is the preeminent global franchise, and private credit, where it is a top player with $250 billion in fee-earning credit assets. These are two of the fastest growing asset classes within alternatives. We believe infrastructure is poised to benefit from the dual tailwinds of the enormous global funding gap in traditional infrastructure – estimated at $100 trillion of required investment through 2040 – and significant new demand for digital infrastructure to support data and compute needs. Brookfield has a long track record of first quartile returns within its global infrastructure business and a 100+ year history as an owner-operator of real assets that predates its asset management franchise. In 2022, it raised its offshoot Global Transition fund at in our view an impressive $13 billion first vintage, and in 2023, it closed on the largest infrastructure drawdown fund ever raised at $28 billion. In private credit, Brookfield has combined Oaktree, which it acquired in 2019, its unique debt origination capabilities in infrastructure and real estate, and a large and growing insurance franchise that is writing almost $20 billion of new business annually. This combination of an origination and investing platform with a stable base of insurance demand we believe positions Brookfield to benefit from the step-function growth we are observing across private credit. Despite its evident scale, strong growth, and continued tailwinds around asset accumulation, we believe Brookfield is an under-appreciated and under-covered equity story. The stock Page 3 trades at ~13x next year’s earnings – more comparable to the valuation of share-losing traditional asset managers than scale alternative peers at 20-30x. We believe the catalysts for a re-rating are in place. Management has started to simplify the equity story and improve its communication with investors. We believe Brookfield is a business that has both a re-rating opportunity and strong earnings compounding in the underlying asset. Live Nation Entertainment During Q2, we made an investment in Live Nation Entertainment (LYV), the leading integrated global concert company. Having studied the business model and management’s accomplishments for many years, we saw, in our view, an attractive entry point after the shares dislocated on news of an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice (DoJ). We believe LYV is set to compound earnings at a double-digit rate through the next decade driven by strong demand for concerts, robust pricing power, and a sizeable opportunity to reinvest in owned and operated venues. Live Nation participates in all major parts of the concert value chain (promotion, venue management, ticketing, and sponsorship). Concerts are a $35 billion global industry that has compounded revenue at ~8% per annum since 2000, driven by consistent tailwinds in both supply and demand. Artists are eager to tour because live performances drive most of their income and the rise of social media and streaming music has allowed artists to quickly build a larger, global fanbase. The number of artists selling 250k+ tickets per tour has risen by almost 50% since 2019. While Live Nation has long benefited from these trends, we believe the growth in international demand has created a particularly compelling opportunity in venue construction that the company is just beginning to capitalize on. There is a global undersupply of concert venues; even large music markets such as South Korea and Western Europe have only a third of the seating capacity per capita of the US. We believe Live Nation, as a well-capitalized operator with incredible data on market-by-market trends and multiple monetization vectors, is uniquely positioned to invest in increasing capacity at ~20%+ IRRs. The company is spending over $2 billion on this initiative over the next five years, and we believe the returns are underappreciated by the market. Page 4 In May, Live Nation was sued by the DoJ for “unlawful, monopolistic conduct” resulting from the 2010 Ticketmaster merger. The government demanded a divestiture of Ticketmaster, stating that the merger has driven higher prices for fans and “fewer real choices” for venue ticketing services. It is not clear to us why separating these two businesses would drive lower prices for consumers, better outcomes for artists, or better service for venues. It is the artist who decides the face value of the ticket, while service fees are set by and largely benefit the venues. Ticketmaster itself only takes about 5%-7% of gross ticket value inclusive of fees with contracts determined by a competitive RFP process. Ticketmaster’s market share in fact appears to have declined ~10 points since the time of the merger due to new entrants such as SeatGeek. We do not believe the DoJ has cited evidence in their lawsuit that LYV has violated behavioral guardrails instated in 2019 after a separate comprehensive review of the merger. Finally, we note that Live Nation’s largest promotion competitor, AEG, also purchased a leading ticketing vendor in 2019 (AXS), which appears at odds with the views expressed in the lawsuit. We are optimistic that a return to traditional antitrust frameworks under the new Administration will create an opportunity to discuss solutions that mitigate regulator concerns about the industry without requiring the divestiture of Ticketmaster. Siemens Energy We established a new position in Siemens Energy late in Q3. Siemens Energy is a manufacturer of gas turbines, electrical grid equipment, and wind turbines. Spun out from Siemens AG in 2020, Siemens Energy’s wind business has accumulated total operating losses of nearly €7 billion from 2022 to 2024 due to component failures and poorly negotiated commercial contracts. We believe these conditions led to a severely depressed stock price despite favorable fundamentals in the company’s other business segments. Our research indicates that the wind issues were adequately provisioned for, and that risk management has significantly improved. As we see it, the key attractions of the investment case are the resurging gas turbine business and the secular growth in grid products. The growth in renewable energy generation, EV Page 5 charging, and data centers have major implications for Siemens’ products. First, renewables run at only 20-30% capacity utilizations and given their large land requirements, are often located far from large demand centers. This means we need to connect 3-4x the amount of generation over longer distances when compared to traditional dispatchable generation like coal, nuclear or gas. Second, the electrification of transport as well as demand from data centers is leading to growth in overall peak power demand. Regardless of how much renewable generation the world adds, growth in peak power demand necessitates growth in dispatchable generation for the time periods when renewables are not available. We believe these two trends have yielded a step-function increase in the demand for grid equipment and gas turbines, two of Siemens’ core businesses. Supply shortages and extended lead times have resulted in a favorable pricing environment after a decade of anemic growth. Siemens Energy has built a €123 billion backlog, representing 3.6x annual revenue, which provides good visibility into outsized organic revenue and earnings growth. We estimate that Siemens Energy’s earnings power will exceed €5 per share by the end of the decade. Equity Position Update PG&E Corporation We are devastated by the recent events in Southern California. Several of our family members and team members call Los Angeles home, and our hearts are with all impacted by the fires. While PG&E does not operate in this region, there is press speculation that one of the fires, Eaton, may have been related to transmission equipment owned by SoCal Edison (SCE), another investor-owned utility (parent company Edison International.) Edison has stated publicly that they do not believe their equipment was involved. The investigation is ongoing, and we believe it is premature to make conclusions about the origin of the fire. If the Eaton fire ignition was related to SCE equipment, the California legal standard of “inverse condemnation” exposes SCE to resultant property damage liabilities. After PG&E’s bankruptcy in 2019, California passed a bill called AB1054 which protects the state’s investor-owned utilities (Edison, PG&E and Sempra) from these liabilities as long as they Page 6 adhere to a rigorous safety standard. This includes a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan approved annually by the government and a commitment to spend billions to harden the grid; for example, PG&E is spending a whopping $18 billion on wildfire mitigation from 2023 -2025. In exchange, AB1054 includes several protections, such as a legal prudency standard that entitles the utility to cost recovery via multiple avenues in the event of a catastrophic fire and a $21 billion insurance fund to cover incurred liabilities. SCE has an active safety certificate and thus should benefit from the protections under AB 1054, just as PG&E would in case of a future fire. Regulator-approved cost recovery is a routine proceeding for utilities in areas prone to severe climate events (hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.) in acknowledgement of the fact that it is not feasible to remove all risk from overhead grid infrastructure. PCG has been the preeminent advocate in California for undergrounding, which we believe is the only way to permanently eliminate wildfire risk from grid assets. PG&E is now trading slightly below 10x 2026 earnings, versus regulated utility peers trading above 15x. We note that PG&E is trading at roughly the same multiple as Edison despite zero direct financial liabilities from the events in Los Angeles. We believe investors are overly discounting the financial and legal protections provided by AB 1054. We expect more clarity from the state over the coming weeks and months. Corporate Credit Update Third Point’s corporate credit book generated a 4.2% gross return (3.8% net) during the Fourth Quarter, contributing ~60 basis points to net performance. That result put 2024 performance at +13.0% gross (11.3% net), approximately +480 basis points ahead of the ICE BofA US High Yield Index. Our corporate credit portfolio significantly outperformed in the Fourth Quarter thanks to a (regrettably, in hindsight) small position in the GSE preferred securities, as well as strong performance in our broadband credits. While our corporate credit book was up in December, the hawkish Federal Open Market Committee commentary that accompanied the rate cut pressured risk assets and resulted in both increased rates and spreads. Rates enjoyed a relief rally on the December CPI print, but Page 7 10-year Treasury yields remain above 4.5%, more than 300 basis points higher than the 2020/21 average. As we have mentioned before, we believe that the high yield Class of 2020/21, which saw record volumes of leverage buyouts financed at high valuations and record low yields, will face significant credit stress as their debt matures over the next few years. While defaults have been very low, we are already seeing increased levels of debt exchanges and anticipate that this pace will increase, especially if interest rates remain near current levels, let alone move higher. We believe Liability Management Exercises, (LME’s) have become the most engaging distressed credit opportunities. LME’s involve an out of court exchange offer where a sponsor is seeking to reduce the principal amount of debt, reduce interest expense and/or extend maturities. While the goal (extend the runway for the equity, perhaps forestall a large write down) and rules of these exchanges (generally the “waterfall” of creditor priority is attacked through covenant loopholes) are different from an in-court bankruptcy, the investment opportunities are similar. On the front end, active participation in an LME process can create new securities at very attractive levels. On the back end, there is sometimes a very attractive “post-LME” technical where creditors are eager to exit following the process for several reasons. On a fundamental level, post-LME credits often have a robust capital structure, longer liquidity runways and better covenant packages. That said, not all LME’s are true fixes. While it’s relatively rare to see a company (outside those in secular decline) undergo bankruptcy twice (the ignominious “Chapter 22”), it’s interesting to note that about 40% of credits that undergo out-of-court exchanges ultimately file for bankruptcy anyway. As a result, credit selection remains important. At present we invested in five situations that have undergone LME’s in the last year. We are invested in another eight that we anticipate will undergo LMEs in the next six months. Overall, recent, current and prospective LME situations represent almost half of our current corporate credit portfolio, or over $700 million. We expect this area to be an important source of alpha in the coming months. Page 8 Structured Credit Update In 2024, three major themes drove returns and we expect these same trends will create interesting opportunities over the next 18 months. Although the new Administration is still formulating its policies, deregulation is expected to be a key element, which we believe would be a positive tailwind for structured credit given the high regulatory capital charges for banks since 2009. Given structured credit spreads are wider to every other asset class, we anticipate more spread compression in 2025. These three themes are: Rates and Mortgages: Despite the volatility in rates and changing expectations of the Fed’s rate cut plan, 5-year Treasuries rose 50 basis points in 2024. We anticipate that rates will remain range-bound, creating a high base rate for structured credit assets. We called five unrated reperforming mortgage deals this year, monetizing approximately 25% and refinancing into rated securitizations where we sold AAAs through single A. We now own rated tranches with increased liquidity and potential upside for spread duration as insurance companies look for rated assets. Residential mortgages continue to be a source of strength for the consumer, with borrowers still holding, on average, 50% equity in their homes. We are starting to see the first signs of a slowdown in subprime, viewed through consumer unsecured and subprime auto loans and have reduced exposure in those sectors. Securities vs. Loans: While headlines in structured credit this year were dominated by synthetic risk transfer (SRT) and portfolio sales, we focused on opportunistic trades like auto ABS and non-qualified mortgage BBs. We were very active in both loan purchases and SRT about three years ago when gross IRR expectations were in the mid- to high-teens. Today, we feel that market is crowded with advertised yields in the teens, but actual returns below 10%. In contrast, we focused on generating alpha through secondary trading. As more fixed income moves to both insurance and private credit funds, we have been able to source, in our view, compelling risk-adjusted returns through active trading and providing liquidity when money managers need it. Insurance companies have spurred a technical bid up of mortgage loans this year, but we are finding 100-200 basis points of wider spread in the BB tranches with credit support. Page 9 Credit Spread Tightening: Many investors have asked in recent weeks about credit spread widening and what is interesting these days. While the investment grade corporate index is close to all time tights in the mid-40s basis points, we believe structured credit still has room to rally. As an example, residential mortgage-backed AAAs are between a 115-135 basis point spread compared to the historical tights in 2021 in the 60s. Looking to 2025, bank M&A activity is expected to increase, which will likely result in more banks selling consumer and mortgage loan portfolios. We will be opportunistic on smaller portfolios where we expect to get paid a high-single digits unlevered yield on the loans with the ability to create mid-teens returns on our retained exposure. Acquisition of Birch Grove In late December, we announced our intention to acquire 100% of AS Birch Grove, a diversified alternative credit fund manager with approximately $8 billion of AUM. The transaction is expected to close in mid-February. Birch Grove was founded by President Andrew Fink and CEO and CIO Jonathan Berger — who will become Third Point’s Co-Head of Credit alongside Partner Ian Wallace. Ian, Steve Schatzman, Shalini Sriram, and Chris Taylor will maintain their existing roles and work with Jonathan and me to develop new credit products reflecting the firms’ complementary strategies. Birch Grove’s funds include a well-established CLO business with over $5 billion in AUM, a private credit offering that complements our current skillset, a credit solutions product, and several other strategies. While Birch Grove and Third Point funds will continue to be separately managed by their long-tenured teams, we are excited about the capabilities the Birch Grove acquisition will add to the credit efforts in the main funds and to our dedicated structured, corporate, and private credit offerings. We anticipate significant synergies between Third Point’s newly created private credit effort and Birch Grove. We expect that the CLO business, focused on tradeable term loans, will help Page 10 both our structured and corporate credit efforts by providing a window into over 400 leveraged loans that can serve as an early warning system for potential stressed and distressed opportunities. Our structured credit effort actively trades CLO liabilities and Birch Grove will continue to be an active issuer of those liabilities, which we believe can provide helpful perspectives on supply and pricing of those securities. These are just a few of the synergies we expect to find as the businesses begin closer collaboration in an environment where clients are looking for innovative solutions across the credit spectrum. Our Business Development team will be happy to share opportunities in new credit products as they become available in the coming months.

Dear Investor:
During the Fourth Quarter, Third Point returned 9.1% in the flagship Offshore Fund. For the

Third Point’s flagship Offshore Fund generated net returns of 9.1% in the fourth quarter, and

highlighted our diversified portfolio of equity investments, some with event-driven catalysts,
others with quality characteristics, and several idiosyncratic themes that differentiated our
return makeup from the S&P. As market returns broadened during the second half of the
year, we believe we were well positioned to take advantage. In our view, successful portfolio
rotation into consumer discretionary, financials and industrial names helped us capture the
upside of the post-election rally we predicted in our Q3 letter. This positioning drove our Q4
equity RoA to 10.7% gross (10.1% net), outperforming the S&P 500’s +2.4% and MSCI
World’s -0.1%.
Outlook
Since the November election, we have observed economics and policy becoming increasingly
intertwined. Although business leaders are generally optimistic about economic growth and
reduced bureaucracy and regulation, uncertainty around certain policies and strategies
remains. In our view, it has never been more important to employ second-order thinking
about news headlines in general, and certain policy declarations in particular. In the past
week, DeepSeek, the Chinese LLM application, caused a panic in technology markets, calling
into question everything from the future demand for Nvidia chips to power demand for data
centers. Initial reports that the app was built on open-source data on antiquated chips by
moonlighting hedge fund quants were subsequently debunked. This is not to say that
DeepSeek is not a stunning breakthrough, but we believe the initial reaction seems to have
been overdone. We believe there are many companies such as Meta and others that will
likely benefit from the technology. Similarly, as we saw, the Administration’s recently
announced tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China will be less impactful than the headlines
currently implied; we see more modest tariffs, implemented by the Treasury and Commerce
departments, early this spring.
Overall, we expect the environment for investing in equities to continue to be favorable, with
the caveat that there will likely be periodic dislocations caused by the unconventional
approach of this Administration in conveying and enacting policy that affects markets and
the economy. In this environment, we believe an unemotional response, independent of
one’s political views, is critical to making good investment decisions. We remain optimistic
Page 2

about the sectors that will benefit from certain of these policies, as well as an increase in
M&A and other corporate activity which feeds our event-driven framework.
New Equity Positions
Brookfield Corp.
Last summer we initiated a position in Brookfield Corp. Brookfield is one of the largest global
alternative asset managers with over $500 billion in fee-earning AUM. We believe Brookfield
is uniquely positioned to be a beneficiary of the secular growth tailwinds around
infrastructure, where it is the preeminent global franchise, and private credit, where it is a
top player with $250 billion in fee-earning credit assets. These are two of the fastest growing
asset classes within alternatives.
We believe infrastructure is poised to benefit from the dual tailwinds of the enormous global
funding gap in traditional infrastructure – estimated at $100 trillion of required investment
through 2040 – and significant new demand for digital infrastructure to support data and
compute needs. Brookfield has a long track record of first quartile returns within its global
infrastructure business and a 100+ year history as an owner-operator of real assets that
predates its asset management franchise. In 2022, it raised its offshoot Global Transition
fund at in our view an impressive $13 billion first vintage, and in 2023, it closed on the largest
infrastructure drawdown fund ever raised at $28 billion.
In private credit, Brookfield has combined Oaktree, which it acquired in 2019, its unique debt
origination capabilities in infrastructure and real estate, and a large and growing insurance
franchise that is writing almost $20 billion of new business annually. This combination of an
origination and investing platform with a stable base of insurance demand we believe
positions Brookfield to benefit from the step-function growth we are observing across
private credit.
Despite its evident scale, strong growth, and continued tailwinds around asset accumulation,
we believe Brookfield is an under-appreciated and under-covered equity story. The stock
Page 3

trades at ~13x next year’s earnings – more comparable to the valuation of share-losing
traditional asset managers than scale alternative peers at 20-30x. We believe the catalysts
for a re-rating are in place. Management has started to simplify the equity story and improve
its communication with investors. We believe Brookfield is a business that has both a re-
rating opportunity and strong earnings compounding in the underlying asset.
Live Nation Entertainment
During Q2, we made an investment in Live Nation Entertainment (LYV), the leading
integrated global concert company. Having studied the business model and management’s
accomplishments for many years, we saw, in our view, an attractive entry point after the
shares dislocated on news of an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice (DoJ). We
believe LYV is set to compound earnings at a double-digit rate through the next decade
driven by strong demand for concerts, robust pricing power, and a sizeable opportunity to
reinvest in owned and operated venues.
Live Nation participates in all major parts of the concert value chain (promotion, venue
management, ticketing, and sponsorship). Concerts are a $35 billion global industry that has
compounded revenue at ~8% per annum since 2000, driven by consistent tailwinds in both
supply and demand. Artists are eager to tour because live performances drive most of their
income and the rise of social media and streaming music has allowed artists to quickly build
a larger, global fanbase. The number of artists selling 250k+ tickets per tour has risen by
almost 50% since 2019. While Live Nation has long benefited from these trends, we believe
the growth in international demand has created a particularly compelling opportunity in
venue construction that the company is just beginning to capitalize on. There is a global
undersupply of concert venues; even large music markets such as South Korea and Western
Europe have only a third of the seating capacity per capita of the US. We believe Live Nation,
as a well-capitalized operator with incredible data on market-by-market trends and multiple
monetization vectors, is uniquely positioned to invest in increasing capacity at ~20%+ IRRs.
The company is spending over $2 billion on this initiative over the next five years, and we
believe the returns are underappreciated by the market.
Page 4

In May, Live Nation was sued by the DoJ for “unlawful, monopolistic conduct” resulting from
the 2010 Ticketmaster merger. The government demanded a divestiture of Ticketmaster,
stating that the merger has driven higher prices for fans and “fewer real choices” for venue
ticketing services. It is not clear to us why separating these two businesses would drive
lower prices for consumers, better outcomes for artists, or better service for venues. It is the
artist who decides the face value of the ticket, while service fees are set by and largely benefit
the venues. Ticketmaster itself only takes about 5%-7% of gross ticket value inclusive of fees
with contracts determined by a competitive RFP process. Ticketmaster’s market share in
fact appears to have declined ~10 points since the time of the merger due to new entrants
such as SeatGeek. We do not believe the DoJ has cited evidence in their lawsuit that LYV has
violated behavioral guardrails instated in 2019 after a separate comprehensive review of the
merger. Finally, we note that Live Nation’s largest promotion competitor, AEG, also
purchased a leading ticketing vendor in 2019 (AXS), which appears at odds with the views
expressed in the lawsuit. We are optimistic that a return to traditional antitrust frameworks
under the new Administration will create an opportunity to discuss solutions that mitigate
regulator concerns about the industry without requiring the divestiture of Ticketmaster.
Siemens Energy
We established a new position in Siemens Energy late in Q3. Siemens Energy is a
manufacturer of gas turbines, electrical grid equipment, and wind turbines. Spun out from
Siemens AG in 2020, Siemens Energy’s wind business has accumulated total operating losses
of nearly €7 billion from 2022 to 2024 due to component failures and poorly negotiated
commercial contracts. We believe these conditions led to a severely depressed stock price
despite favorable fundamentals in the company’s other business segments. Our research
indicates that the wind issues were adequately provisioned for, and that risk management
has significantly improved.
As we see it, the key attractions of the investment case are the resurging gas turbine business
and the secular growth in grid products. The growth in renewable energy generation, EV
charging, and data centers have major implications for Siemens’ products. First, renewables
Page 5

run at only 20-30% capacity utilizations and given their large land requirements, are often
located far from large demand centers. This means we need to connect 3-4x the amount of
generation over longer distances when compared to traditional dispatchable generation like
coal, nuclear or gas. Second, the electrification of transport as well as demand from data
centers is leading to growth in overall peak power demand. Regardless of how much
renewable generation the world adds, growth in peak power demand necessitates growth in
dispatchable generation for the time periods when renewables are not available. We believe
these two trends have yielded a step-function increase in the demand for grid equipment
and gas turbines, two of Siemens’ core businesses. Supply shortages and extended lead times
have resulted in a favorable pricing environment after a decade of anemic growth. Siemens
Energy has built a €123 billion backlog, representing 3.6x annual revenue, which provides
good visibility into outsized organic revenue and earnings growth. We estimate that Siemens
Energy’s earnings power will exceed €5 per share by the end of the decade.
Equity Position Update
PG&E Corporation
We are devastated by the recent events in Southern California. Several of our family
members and team members call Los Angeles home, and our hearts are with all impacted by
the fires.
While PG&E does not operate in this region, there is press speculation that one of the fires,
Eaton, may have been related to transmission equipment owned by SoCal Edison (SCE),
another investor-owned utility (parent company Edison International.) Edison has stated
publicly that they do not believe their equipment was involved. The investigation is ongoing,
and we believe it is premature to make conclusions about the origin of the fire.
If the Eaton fire ignition was related to SCE equipment, the California legal standard of
“inverse condemnation” exposes SCE to resultant property damage liabilities. After PG&E’s
bankruptcy in 2019, California passed a bill called AB1054 which protects the state’s
investor-owned utilities (Edison, PG&E and Sempra) from these liabilities as long as they
Page 6

adhere to a rigorous safety standard. This includes a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan
approved annually by the government and a commitment to spend billions to harden the
grid; for example, PG&E is spending a whopping $18 billion on wildfire mitigation from 2023
-2025. In exchange, AB1054 includes several protections, such as a legal prudency standard
that entitles the utility to cost recovery via multiple avenues in the event of a catastrophic
fire and a $21 billion insurance fund to cover incurred liabilities. SCE has an active safety
certificate and thus should benefit from the protections under AB 1054, just as PG&E would
in case of a future fire. Regulator-approved cost recovery is a routine proceeding for utilities
in areas prone to severe climate events (hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.) in
acknowledgement of the fact that it is not feasible to remove all risk from overhead grid
infrastructure. PCG has been the preeminent advocate in California for undergrounding,
which we believe is the only way to permanently eliminate wildfire risk from grid assets.
PG&E is now trading slightly below 10x 2026 earnings, versus regulated utility peers trading
above 15x. We note that PG&E is trading at roughly the same multiple as Edison despite zero
direct financial liabilities from the events in Los Angeles. We believe investors are overly
discounting the financial and legal protections provided by AB 1054. We expect more clarity
from the state over the coming weeks and months.
Corporate Credit Update
Third Point’s corporate credit book generated a 4.2% gross return (3.8% net) during the
Fourth Quarter, contributing ~60 basis points to net performance. That result put 2024
performance at +13.0% gross (11.3% net), approximately +480 basis points ahead of the ICE
BofA US High Yield Index. Our corporate credit portfolio significantly outperformed in the
Fourth Quarter thanks to a (regrettably, in hindsight) small position in the GSE preferred
securities, as well as strong performance in our broadband credits.
While our corporate credit book was up in December, the hawkish Federal Open Market
Committee commentary that accompanied the rate cut pressured risk assets and resulted in
both increased rates and spreads. Rates enjoyed a relief rally on the December CPI print, but
Page 7

10-year Treasury yields remain above 4.5%, more than 300 basis points higher than the
2020/21 average. As we have mentioned before, we believe that the high yield Class of
2020/21, which saw record volumes of leverage buyouts financed at high valuations and
record low yields, will face significant credit stress as their debt matures over the next few
years. While defaults have been very low, we are already seeing increased levels of debt
exchanges and anticipate that this pace will increase, especially if interest rates remain near
current levels, let alone move higher.
We believe Liability Management Exercises, (LME’s) have become the most engaging
distressed credit opportunities. LME’s involve an out of court exchange offer where a
sponsor is seeking to reduce the principal amount of debt, reduce interest expense and/or
extend maturities. While the goal (extend the runway for the equity, perhaps forestall a large
write down) and rules of these exchanges (generally the “waterfall” of creditor priority is
attacked through covenant loopholes) are different from an in-court bankruptcy, the
investment opportunities are similar. On the front end, active participation in an LME
process can create new securities at very attractive levels. On the back end, there is
sometimes a very attractive “post-LME” technical where creditors are eager to exit following
the process for several reasons. On a fundamental level, post-LME credits often have a robust
capital structure, longer liquidity runways and better covenant packages.
That said, not all LME’s are true fixes. While it’s relatively rare to see a company (outside
those in secular decline) undergo bankruptcy twice (the ignominious “Chapter 22”), it’s
interesting to note that about 40% of credits that undergo out-of-court exchanges ultimately
file for bankruptcy anyway. As a result, credit selection remains important.
At present we invested in five situations that have undergone LME’s in the last year. We are
invested in another eight that we anticipate will undergo LMEs in the next six months.
Overall, recent, current and prospective LME situations represent almost half of our current
corporate credit portfolio, or over $700 million. We expect this area to be an important
source of alpha in the coming months.

Structured Credit Update
In 2024, three major themes drove returns and we expect these same trends will create
interesting opportunities over the next 18 months. Although the new Administration is still
formulating its policies, deregulation is expected to be a key element, which we believe
would be a positive tailwind for structured credit given the high regulatory capital charges
for banks since 2009. Given structured credit spreads are wider to every other asset class,
we anticipate more spread compression in 2025. These three themes are:
Rates and Mortgages: Despite the volatility in rates and changing expectations of the Fed’s
rate cut plan, 5-year Treasuries rose 50 basis points in 2024. We anticipate that rates will
remain range-bound, creating a high base rate for structured credit assets. We called five
unrated reperforming mortgage deals this year, monetizing approximately 25% and
refinancing into rated securitizations where we sold AAAs through single A. We now own
rated tranches with increased liquidity and potential upside for spread duration as insurance
companies look for rated assets. Residential mortgages continue to be a source of strength
for the consumer, with borrowers still holding, on average, 50% equity in their homes. We
are starting to see the first signs of a slowdown in subprime, viewed through consumer
unsecured and subprime auto loans and have reduced exposure in those sectors.
Securities vs. Loans: While headlines in structured credit this year were dominated by
synthetic risk transfer (SRT) and portfolio sales, we focused on opportunistic trades like auto
ABS and non-qualified mortgage BBs. We were very active in both loan purchases and SRT
about three years ago when gross IRR expectations were in the mid- to high-teens. Today,
we feel that market is crowded with advertised yields in the teens, but actual returns below
10%. In contrast, we focused on generating alpha through secondary trading. As more fixed
income moves to both insurance and private credit funds, we have been able to source, in
our view, compelling risk-adjusted returns through active trading and providing liquidity
when money managers need it. Insurance companies have spurred a technical bid up of
mortgage loans this year, but we are finding 100-200 basis points of wider spread in the BB
tranches with credit support.
Page 9

Credit Spread Tightening: Many investors have asked in recent weeks about credit spread
widening and what is interesting these days. While the investment grade corporate index is
close to all time tights in the mid-40s basis points, we believe structured credit still has room
to rally. As an example, residential mortgage-backed AAAs are between a 115-135 basis
point spread compared to the historical tights in 2021 in the 60s.
Looking to 2025, bank M&A activity is expected to increase, which will likely result in more
banks selling consumer and mortgage loan portfolios. We will be opportunistic on smaller
portfolios where we expect to get paid a high-single digits unlevered yield on the loans with
the ability to create mid-teens returns on our retained exposure.
Acquisition of Birch Grove
In late December, we announced our intention to acquire 100% of AS Birch Grove, a
diversified alternative credit fund manager with approximately $8 billion of AUM. The
transaction is expected to close in mid-February. Birch Grove was founded by President
Andrew Fink and CEO and CIO Jonathan Berger — who will become Third Point’s Co-Head
of Credit alongside Partner Ian Wallace. Ian, Steve Schatzman, Shalini Sriram, and Chris
Taylor will maintain their existing roles and work with Jonathan and me to develop new
credit products reflecting the firms’ complementary strategies.
Birch Grove’s funds include a well-established CLO business with over $5 billion in AUM, a
private credit offering that complements our current skillset, a credit solutions product, and
several other strategies. While Birch Grove and Third Point funds will continue to be
separately managed by their long-tenured teams, we are excited about the capabilities the
Birch Grove acquisition will add to the credit efforts in the main funds and to our dedicated
structured, corporate, and private credit offerings.
We anticipate significant synergies between Third Point’s newly created private credit effort
and Birch Grove. We expect that the CLO business, focused on tradeable term loans, will help
Page 10

both our structured and corporate credit efforts by providing a window into over 400
leveraged loans that can serve as an early warning system for potential stressed and
distressed opportunities. Our structured credit effort actively trades CLO liabilities and
Birch Grove will continue to be an active issuer of those liabilities, which we believe can
provide helpful perspectives on supply and pricing of those securities. These are just a few
of the synergies we expect to find as the businesses begin closer collaboration in an
environment where clients are looking for innovative solutions across the credit spectrum.
Our Business Development team will be happy to share opportunities in new credit products
as they become available in the coming months.

The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed
on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third
Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser
headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Master Fund LP in a master-feeder structure. Third
Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.
Page 11

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Master Fund LP inclusive of legacy private
investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable. Sector and geographic categories are
determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.
Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.
While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the
indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ
significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All information

Cedar Creek Partners,Tim Eriksen,"January 20, 2023",2022.0,4.0,6.2,S&P 500,7.6,-1.3999999999999995,"The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the Fund’s auditors.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the closing price as of the previous month end.

Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

Growth stocks were hit the hardest, with the NASDAQ declining by 33% on the year. The best performing index we compare against, was the DJIA, which, thanks to a strong fourth quarter, declined by only 7% on the year. Cedar Creek increased by 6.2% in the fourth quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was up 8.8% in 2022, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 year history is 14.2%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 848.4%, net of fees and expenses. Q4 ‘22 ’22 YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 6.2% 8.8% 848.4% 14.2% NASDAQ -1.0% -33.1% 351.7% 9.3% DJIA (DIA) 15.9% -7.0% 346.6% 9.2% S&P 500 (SPY) 7.6% -18.2% 314.0% 8.7% Russell 2000 6.2% -20.4% 212.4% 6.9% Russell Microcap 4.7% -22.0% 155.7% 5.7% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $948,418 as of December 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $255,713 in the Russell Micro Cap and $451,810 in the NASDAQ. 1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of December 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 6 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 0.9%. Weighted return on equity as of December 31, 2022 was 22%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the year at 6%. We made minor changes to the portfolio during the quarter, exiting small positions like bebe stores (BEBE), Butler National (BUKS), BankFirst (BFCC), Sonics & Materials (SIMA) and Spindletop (SPND). We only sold BankFirst to allocate to other ECIP recipients we believe were more attractive. We added to Citizens Bankshares (CZBS), PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market increased in the quarter, primarily due to the share price increase of PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of them when they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 29% of the fund. As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 29% of the fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 75% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is about 11% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is 7% of the fund and Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG), which is neither an oil company nor a mortgage company, is nearly 4% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter (link). We will discuss PD-Rx more below. During the fourth quarter we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific Coast Oil Trust. We subsequently added a private investor and Evergreen Capital, who owns 8.5% of the units, to the group bringing it to over 21% of outstanding units. We have called for a Special Meeting to remove the Trustee. We think that the operator, PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust. ARO’s are the cost to return a well back to normal state (i.e., plugging well and removal of equipment, etc.). PCEC contends the Conveyance Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22 (l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement forbids any assessment of costs incurred or accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern what pages 7 and 22 refer to) and secondarily that the proforma financials in the offering documents clearly show the liability remaining with PCEC (see the Offering documents page PCEC F-30 asset retirement obligation line). Meaning it did not transfer to the Trust. 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation when it purchased additional properties in 2008,3 evaluated it annually, and made adjustments accordingly, prior to the trust being created in 2012. At that time, April 2012, the ARO was approximately $22.3 million4 and should have accreted (compounded) at approximately a 7 to 9% rate annually. After ten years of accretion, it would be nearly double the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the amount the operator says the assessed ARO obligation was. Further, in all the Offering document proformas no assessment was made to the trust for asset retirement obligations, nor was the Trust assessed any ARO obligation from 2012 through 2019 when, interestingly enough, PCEC was purchased by new owners. Our argument is that the ARO should not have been assessed to the Trust (unitholders) at all. Thus, all the funds that have been withheld need to be repaid with interest. If true, the operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or $0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its current $17 million market cap and $0.44 per unit price, and distributions would resume at approximately $.023 per unit per month, or $0.28 annually.5 We think fair value of the units would be in excess of $2.00 per unit under this scenario, or five times the current price. What if courts disagreed that the ARO was assessable? Would it be fully assessable or partially? We contend that it is clear in the conveyance agreement that the Trust can only be assessed costs related to production during its existence, not production that pre-dates the creation of the trust or future production. That would mean the ARO cost has to be allocated to production units since PCEC, the operator, purchased the fields, and only the portion related to the time the Trust has been a recipient of cash flows is assessable to the Trust. This would still mean excess funds have been withheld and would be returned and distributions would resume. Under this scenario, we think fair value would be above $1.25 per unit, or nearly three times the current price. We also believe that the funds should be escrowed since if any of the properties/fields were sold, the ARO transfers to the buyer, thus releasing the obligation. Further we contend that the funds withheld should be credited the discount rate, currently 9%, used in the ARO calculation to avoid double assessment. In other words, the amount that has been paid is the present value of future costs discounted back to the present. It would be double assessment to then assess the increase in the present value due to time to the Trust. Since the amount is pre-paid the obligation to earn the discount rate should be borne by the operator. Obviously, there is some chance that the courts deem the ARO fully assessable, ignore our calling of a Special Meeting, and allow the Trustee to proceed to an auction since the Trust did not receive the minimum required distributions from PCEC in 2020 and 2021. A strong case can be made that an auction of the properties is clearly a sale and that the ARO obligation transfers to the buyer and the withheld ARO must be paid back to the Trust with interest along with any proceeds from the auction. Even if that argument was rejected, then the near full payment of the ARO obligation means that cash flows would resume in six months from today and in even less time by the time any auction closed. While the buyer 3 See PCEC page F-9 on initial S-1 filing for purchase allocation and Note 7 on PCEC F-20,21 for ARO changes: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1538822/000119312512005276/d273119ds1.htm#toc273119_23 It is our understanding that the West Pico and Sawtell properties were purchased in 1992. 4 The $22.3 million is actually the December 2011 amount. The amount should have accreted by the 7% discount rate through March 31, 2012 plus any other revisions. We have not seen publicly reported amount for March 31,2012. 5 We are aware that the local refinery is closing in early 2023 and recognize that the Trust may have to pay its share to temporarily truck its oil to refineries further away while it builds a pipeline to connect to the major pipeline nearby. The cost of the pipeline could result in the temporary loss of one or two quarters worth of payments. has to assess the attractiveness of working with PCEC, we still think fair value is above the current price and likely above $1.00 per unit since the ARO obligation would have been paid and monthly distributions resume. While there are a wide range of possible outcomes, we are optimistic that most, if not all, of the ARO that has been assessed is improper. If we are correct, the potential Bonanza scenario we described in our 2022 Q2 letter is more likely. As we said before, time will tell. We added to the position during the quarter. Update on Top Ten Portfolio Holdings as of December 2022 Top 10 Holdings start of 2022 end of 2022 1 Solitron Devices 1 M&F Bancorp 2 PharmChem 2 Solitron Devices 3 Nocopi Technologies 3 Citizens Bankshares 4 BM Technologies 4 PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals 5 PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals 5 Pacific Coast Oil Trust 6 CompuMed 6 Tix Corp (private) 7 CCUR 7 Mortgage Oil 8 Mortgage Oil 8 PharmChem 9 P10 Holdings 9 BM Technologies 10 Western Capital Resources 10 Dyna Group During 2022 we exited Nocopi Technologies (NNUP), CCUR (CCUR) and P10 Holdings (PX). We added M&F Bancorp (MFBP) and Citizens Bankshares (CZBS) as part of our ECIP play. We also added Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), although we had owned it in 2021, but stupidly sold for a modest gain. We also made a private investment joining with Bandera Partners, a private investor, and HSB Capital in buying Tix Corp out of bankruptcy. Below is an update on the larger holdings of the fund: M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares outstanding. In the summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program. The stock is currently at $26 per share. Our cost basis is under $12. In the third quarter M&F earned $0.51 per share. Most of the ECIP funds appear to have still been in cash, likely earning 2% max. Annualizing third quarter earnings gives a $2.05 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to have continued to grow in the fourth quarter on the assumption that some of the cash would have been moved to higher yielding short-term treasuries and some of their loan portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates increasing due to the prime rate being higher) faster than their cost of deposits has increased. A buyer today is paying 11-12 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double or potentially triple from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient banks.) Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 21% in 2022 from $11.00 per share to $8.70 at year end. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron due to a proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting was held in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related to the U.S stockpile program, which noted. In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill. Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending, including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The increased stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to add approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024 and running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024. Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows the significance of a $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted Solitron’s cost savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end of the fiscal second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were recipients of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar characteristics as M&F. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded last at $31 per share. The fund started buying in June at $12 per share, which was less half of common book value, and six times 2021 earnings. Our basis is under $18. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 were about $1.27 per share, giving an annualized rate of over $5 per share. Earnings increased due to a chunk of the ECIP funds being invested in US Treasuries during the quarter. Citizens still had a high amount of cash on its balance sheet as of September 30 and likely increased its securities portfolio in the fourth quarter, further boosting earnings. Assuming a $5 to $6 annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple around 5-6 times. Over time the capital should move from being in 4% treasuries to being leveraged via growing deposits and loans or securities, which will boost earnings further, or Citizens can use the funds to buy another bank and increase earnings that way. Without an acquisition we think the bank can earn $7 per share in 2024 and in excess of $8 per share in 2025. An acquisition would likely speed that timetable up. During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment by TD Bank. Details on the rate were not announced, but we would assume it was favorable as Citizens didn’t really need the capital. Our guess is the rate is around 2% and may have a share of future dividend increases. PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is an expert market stock that has historically released financials yearly on its website. The company manufactures both brand and generic pharmaceuticals from its Oklahoma City facility. The company had been profitable until fiscal 2019 and 2020, when it incurred small losses. They adopted a cost cutting program. In fiscal 2021 they returned to profitability earning roughly $0.40 per share excluding PPP loan forgiveness. Net cash was $1.69 per share. Through November 2022 we steadily increased our ownership as shares were available at prices between $3.05 and $3.60 per share (we assumed we were paying 3-4 times earnings net of cash). In late December 2022 they reported fiscal 2022 results. After results, the stock jumped to $6.00 per share and we continued to purchase. We marked the position at $6.00 per share, which was the last market transaction. For the year ended June 30, 2022, PD-Rx had earnings of $1.83 per share. Book value increased to $6.90 per share. They have no debt, and net cash of $3.33 per share. In addition to the cash, their $4.46 million of receivables is more than double total liabilities. At $6.00 per share we are paying 3.5 times trailing earnings and only 1.5 times trailing earnings net of cash. There was nothing in their annual results or management letter that would lead us to believe that earnings will change in the current year versus the prior year. We think PD-Rx can earn $2.00 per share in fiscal 2023 by just investing a portion of their cash in treasuries. While we would love to own the whole business at $6 per share, we are happy to own a part at that price. If earnings in fiscal 2023 are similar to fiscal 2022 results, then book value as of December 2022 is already at $8 per share. We estimate value based on earnings (free cash flow), not book value, and think the company could easily fetch $20 per share in a sale, and likely above $25. We had seen a few years ago that someone who spoke with management had commented that management said they would sell for 1.5x sales which would be over $26 per share. That seemed high at the time, but not at current earnings levels. All but one person in senior management is above 70 years of age, so a sale may well happen over the next few years. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) was discussed above. Tix Corporation (private) – was a company we previously owned shares in when it was public. The company sells show tickets in Las Vegas. It fell upon hard times during COVID and filed for bankruptcy. It re-opened in the fall of 2021 with three locations on the strip. We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a private investor to bid on the company and were the high bidder. The investment was less than ten percent of the fund’s assets. As of year end it was just over 6% of the fund, and that was after marking it down 20% during the year to reflect performance of the business and general economic and stock market conditions. The business has high fixed costs due to rents along the strip being extremely high. Once fixed costs are covered incremental margins are very attractive. Currently Tix is losing money in the slow months and making money in the busier months. We are adding an additional location this spring and working toward adding online sales in the latter half of the year. Online sales should have a different profitability profile due to the absence of rent and most of the labor and replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at the physical locations. It is still too early to know how well the investment will turn out. Shows are still trying to stick with full cost pricing, a significant departure from the pre-Covid higher volume discount approach, which is a concern. Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG) is also presently trading on the expert market. We covered it in more detail in our Q2 2021 letter. It once went nine years without a published trade. It has only 40,915 shares outstanding. Last trade was at $355.00 per share. They do not invest in oil or mortgages, rather real estate, primarily multi-family and some commercial. We bought almost 2% of the company in an hour in May 2021. Current yield is 4.2% based on yearly $15 dividend. The properties have been on the books long enough their tax basis is negative. That likely means there is potential for gains on sale or distributions via refinancing should rates come back down. Recent distributions from real estate holdings to the company have been roughly $20 per share annually. In addition, cash and securities were $118 per share as of June 2021. We haven’t seen financials since that time. For some reason there is no balance sheet liability accrual for taxes on unrealized gains on marketable securities. We expect the stock to be a long-term holding that can give us real estate exposure and generate double digit returns. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
2022 was a difficult year for both stock and bond markets due to rising interest rates.
Growth stocks were hit the hardest, with the NASDAQ declining by 33% on the year. The
best performing index we compare against, was the DJIA, which, thanks to a strong fourth
quarter, declined by only 7% on the year. Cedar Creek increased by 6.2% in the fourth
quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was up 8.8% in 2022, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 year history is 14.2%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 848.4%, net of fees and expenses.
Q4 ‘22 ’22 YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 6.2% 8.8% 848.4% 14.2%
NASDAQ -1.0% -33.1% 351.7% 9.3%
DJIA (DIA) 15.9% -7.0% 346.6% 9.2%
S&P 500 (SPY) 7.6% -18.2% 314.0% 8.7%
Russell 2000 6.2% -20.4% 212.4% 6.9%
Russell Microcap 4.7% -22.0% 155.7% 5.7%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $948,418
as of December 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $255,713 in the Russell
Micro Cap and $451,810 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of December 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading
at less than 6 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4.5 times
expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book
was 1.3. Dividend yield was 0.9%. Weighted return on equity as of December 31, 2022
was 22%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the year at 6%. We made minor
changes to the portfolio during the quarter, exiting small positions like bebe stores
(BEBE), Butler National (BUKS), BankFirst (BFCC), Sonics & Materials (SIMA) and
Spindletop (SPND). We only sold BankFirst to allocate to other ECIP recipients we believe
were more attractive. We added to Citizens Bankshares (CZBS), PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market increased in the quarter, primarily due
to the share price increase of PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the
buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of them when
they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 29% of the fund.
As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 29% of the
fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 75% of the amount – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is about 11% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL) is 7% of the fund and Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG), which is neither an oil
company nor a mortgage company, is nearly 4% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter,
and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter (link). We will discuss PD-Rx more below.
During the fourth quarter we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific
Coast Oil Trust. We subsequently added a private investor and Evergreen Capital, who
owns 8.5% of the units, to the group bringing it to over 21% of outstanding units. We
have called for a Special Meeting to remove the Trustee. We think that the operator,
PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust.
ARO’s are the cost to return a well back to normal state (i.e., plugging well and removal of
equipment, etc.). PCEC contends the Conveyance Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22
(l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement forbids any assessment of costs incurred
or accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern what pages 7 and 22 refer to)
and secondarily that the proforma financials in the offering documents clearly show the
liability remaining with PCEC (see the Offering documents page PCEC F-30 asset retirement
obligation line). Meaning it did not transfer to the Trust.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation when it purchased additional properties in
2008,3 evaluated it annually, and made adjustments accordingly, prior to the trust being
created in 2012. At that time, April 2012, the ARO was approximately $22.3 million4 and
should have accreted (compounded) at approximately a 7 to 9% rate annually. After ten
years of accretion, it would be nearly double the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the
amount the operator says the assessed ARO obligation was. Further, in all the Offering
document proformas no assessment was made to the trust for asset retirement obligations,
nor was the Trust assessed any ARO obligation from 2012 through 2019 when, interestingly
enough, PCEC was purchased by new owners.
Our argument is that the ARO should not have been assessed to the Trust (unitholders) at
all. Thus, all the funds that have been withheld need to be repaid with interest. If true, the
operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or $0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its
current $17 million market cap and $0.44 per unit price, and distributions would resume at
approximately $.023 per unit per month, or $0.28 annually.5 We think fair value of the
units would be in excess of $2.00 per unit under this scenario, or five times the current
price.
What if courts disagreed that the ARO was assessable? Would it be fully assessable or
partially? We contend that it is clear in the conveyance agreement that the Trust can only
be assessed costs related to production during its existence, not production that pre-dates
the creation of the trust or future production. That would mean the ARO cost has to be
allocated to production units since PCEC, the operator, purchased the fields, and only the
portion related to the time the Trust has been a recipient of cash flows is assessable to the
Trust. This would still mean excess funds have been withheld and would be returned and
distributions would resume. Under this scenario, we think fair value would be above $1.25
per unit, or nearly three times the current price.
We also believe that the funds should be escrowed since if any of the properties/fields were
sold, the ARO transfers to the buyer, thus releasing the obligation. Further we contend that
the funds withheld should be credited the discount rate, currently 9%, used in the ARO
calculation to avoid double assessment. In other words, the amount that has been paid is
the present value of future costs discounted back to the present. It would be double
assessment to then assess the increase in the present value due to time to the Trust. Since
the amount is pre-paid the obligation to earn the discount rate should be borne by the
operator.
Obviously, there is some chance that the courts deem the ARO fully assessable, ignore our
calling of a Special Meeting, and allow the Trustee to proceed to an auction since the Trust
did not receive the minimum required distributions from PCEC in 2020 and 2021. A strong
case can be made that an auction of the properties is clearly a sale and that the ARO
obligation transfers to the buyer and the withheld ARO must be paid back to the Trust with
interest along with any proceeds from the auction. Even if that argument was rejected,
then the near full payment of the ARO obligation means that cash flows would resume in six
months from today and in even less time by the time any auction closed. While the buyer
3 See PCEC page F-9 on initial S-1 filing for purchase allocation and Note 7 on PCEC F-20,21 for ARO changes:
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1538822/000119312512005276/d273119ds1.htm#toc273119_23 It is our
understanding that the West Pico and Sawtell properties were purchased in 1992.
4 The $22.3 million is actually the December 2011 amount. The amount should have accreted by the 7% discount
rate through March 31, 2012 plus any other revisions. We have not seen publicly reported amount for March
31,2012.
5 We are aware that the local refinery is closing in early 2023 and recognize that the Trust may have to pay its share
to temporarily truck its oil to refineries further away while it builds a pipeline to connect to the major pipeline
nearby. The cost of the pipeline could result in the temporary loss of one or two quarters worth of payments.

has to assess the attractiveness of working with PCEC, we still think fair value is above the
current price and likely above $1.00 per unit since the ARO obligation would have been paid
and monthly distributions resume.
While there are a wide range of possible outcomes, we are optimistic that most, if not all, of
the ARO that has been assessed is improper. If we are correct, the potential Bonanza
scenario we described in our 2022 Q2 letter is more likely. As we said before, time will tell.
We added to the position during the quarter.
Update on Top Ten Portfolio Holdings as of December 2022
Top 10 Holdings
start of 2022 end of 2022
1 Solitron Devices 1 M&F Bancorp
2 PharmChem 2 Solitron Devices
3 Nocopi Technologies 3 Citizens Bankshares
4 BM Technologies 4 PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals
5 PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals 5 Pacific Coast Oil Trust
6 CompuMed 6 Tix Corp (private)
7 CCUR 7 Mortgage Oil
8 Mortgage Oil 8 PharmChem
9 P10 Holdings 9 BM Technologies
10 Western Capital Resources 10 Dyna Group
During 2022 we exited Nocopi Technologies (NNUP), CCUR (CCUR) and P10 Holdings
(PX). We added M&F Bancorp (MFBP) and Citizens Bankshares (CZBS) as part of our
ECIP play. We also added Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), although we had owned it in
2021, but stupidly sold for a modest gain. We also made a private investment joining with
Bandera Partners, a private investor, and HSB Capital in buying Tix Corp out of bankruptcy.
Below is an update on the larger holdings of the fund:
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares
outstanding. In the summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US
Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program. The stock is currently at $26 per
share. Our cost basis is under $12. In the third quarter M&F earned $0.51 per share. Most
of the ECIP funds appear to have still been in cash, likely earning 2% max. Annualizing
third quarter earnings gives a $2.05 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to
have continued to grow in the fourth quarter on the assumption that some of the cash
would have been moved to higher yielding short-term treasuries and some of their loan
portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates increasing due to the prime rate being higher)
faster than their cost of deposits has increased.
A buyer today is paying 11-12 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings
double or potentially triple from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by
attracting deposits and making loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more
detailed discussion of ECIP recipient banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 21% in 2022 from $11.00
per share to $8.70 at year end. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron due to a
proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting was held

in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related to the U.S
stockpile program, which noted.
In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.
Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and
to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending,
including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The
increased stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to
add approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024
and running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract
awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024.
Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows
the significance of a $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted Solitron’s cost
savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end of the fiscal
second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1% and 1.5%,
respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were recipients
of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar
characteristics as M&F. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded
last at $31 per share. The fund started buying in June at $12 per share, which was less
half of common book value, and six times 2021 earnings. Our basis is under $18. Citizens
received $95.7 million of additional capital (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does
not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are
available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 were about $1.27 per
share, giving an annualized rate of over $5 per share. Earnings increased due to a chunk of
the ECIP funds being invested in US Treasuries during the quarter.
Citizens still had a high amount of cash on its balance sheet as of September 30 and likely
increased its securities portfolio in the fourth quarter, further boosting earnings. Assuming
a $5 to $6 annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple around 5-6 times.
Over time the capital should move from being in 4% treasuries to being leveraged via
growing deposits and loans or securities, which will boost earnings further, or Citizens can
use the funds to buy another bank and increase earnings that way. Without an acquisition
we think the bank can earn $7 per share in 2024 and in excess of $8 per share in 2025. An
acquisition would likely speed that timetable up.
During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment
by TD Bank. Details on the rate were not announced, but we would assume it was
favorable as Citizens didn’t really need the capital. Our guess is the rate is around 2% and
may have a share of future dividend increases.
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is an expert market stock that has historically released
financials yearly on its website. The company manufactures both brand and generic
pharmaceuticals from its Oklahoma City facility. The company had been profitable until
fiscal 2019 and 2020, when it incurred small losses. They adopted a cost cutting program.
In fiscal 2021 they returned to profitability earning roughly $0.40 per share excluding PPP
loan forgiveness. Net cash was $1.69 per share. Through November 2022 we steadily
increased our ownership as shares were available at prices between $3.05 and $3.60 per
share (we assumed we were paying 3-4 times earnings net of cash). In late December
2022 they reported fiscal 2022 results. After results, the stock jumped to $6.00 per share
and we continued to purchase. We marked the position at $6.00 per share, which was the
last market transaction. For the year ended June 30, 2022, PD-Rx had earnings of $1.83

per share. Book value increased to $6.90 per share. They have no debt, and net cash of
$3.33 per share. In addition to the cash, their $4.46 million of receivables is more than
double total liabilities.
At $6.00 per share we are paying 3.5 times trailing earnings and only 1.5 times trailing
earnings net of cash. There was nothing in their annual results or management letter that
would lead us to believe that earnings will change in the current year versus the prior year.
We think PD-Rx can earn $2.00 per share in fiscal 2023 by just investing a portion of their
cash in treasuries. While we would love to own the whole business at $6 per share, we are
happy to own a part at that price. If earnings in fiscal 2023 are similar to fiscal 2022
results, then book value as of December 2022 is already at $8 per share. We estimate
value based on earnings (free cash flow), not book value, and think the company could
easily fetch $20 per share in a sale, and likely above $25. We had seen a few years ago
that someone who spoke with management had commented that management said they
would sell for 1.5x sales which would be over $26 per share. That seemed high at the time,
but not at current earnings levels. All but one person in senior management is above 70
years of age, so a sale may well happen over the next few years.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) was discussed above.
Tix Corporation (private) – was a company we previously owned shares in when it was
public. The company sells show tickets in Las Vegas. It fell upon hard times during COVID
and filed for bankruptcy. It re-opened in the fall of 2021 with three locations on the strip.
We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a
private investor to bid on the company and were the high bidder. The investment was less
than ten percent of the fund’s assets. As of year end it was just over 6% of the fund, and
that was after marking it down 20% during the year to reflect performance of the business
and general economic and stock market conditions.
The business has high fixed costs due to rents along the strip being extremely high. Once
fixed costs are covered incremental margins are very attractive. Currently Tix is losing
money in the slow months and making money in the busier months. We are adding an
additional location this spring and working toward adding online sales in the latter half of
the year. Online sales should have a different profitability profile due to the absence of rent
and most of the labor and replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at
the physical locations. It is still too early to know how well the investment will turn out.
Shows are still trying to stick with full cost pricing, a significant departure from the pre-
Covid higher volume discount approach, which is a concern.
Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG) is also presently trading on the expert market. We
covered it in more detail in our Q2 2021 letter. It once went nine years without a published
trade. It has only 40,915 shares outstanding. Last trade was at $355.00 per share. They
do not invest in oil or mortgages, rather real estate, primarily multi-family and some
commercial. We bought almost 2% of the company in an hour in May 2021. Current yield
is 4.2% based on yearly $15 dividend. The properties have been on the books long enough
their tax basis is negative. That likely means there is potential for gains on sale or
distributions via refinancing should rates come back down. Recent distributions from real
estate holdings to the company have been roughly $20 per share annually. In addition,
cash and securities were $118 per share as of June 2021. We haven’t seen financials since
that time. For some reason there is no balance sheet liability accrual for taxes on unrealized
gains on marketable securities. We expect the stock to be a long-term holding that can
give us real estate exposure and generate double digit returns.

Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider
referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are
1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high
net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.
Forward Looking Statements
This letter and the accompanying discussion include forward-looking statements. All statements that are
not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including any statements that relate to future market
conditions, results, operations, strategies or other future conditions or developments and any statements
regarding objectives, opportunities, positioning or prospects. Forward-looking statements are

Cedar Creek Partners,Tim Eriksen,"January 20, 2023",2022.0,4.0,6.2,Russell 2000,6.2,0.0,"The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the Fund’s auditors.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the closing price as of the previous month end.

Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

Growth stocks were hit the hardest, with the NASDAQ declining by 33% on the year. The best performing index we compare against, was the DJIA, which, thanks to a strong fourth quarter, declined by only 7% on the year. Cedar Creek increased by 6.2% in the fourth quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was up 8.8% in 2022, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 year history is 14.2%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 848.4%, net of fees and expenses.

Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $948,418 as of December 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $255,713 in the Russell Micro Cap and $451,810 in the NASDAQ. 1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of December 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 6 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4.5 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 0.9%. Weighted return on equity as of December 31, 2022 was 22%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the year at 6%. We made minor changes to the portfolio during the quarter, exiting small positions like bebe stores (BEBE), Butler National (BUKS), BankFirst (BFCC), Sonics & Materials (SIMA) and Spindletop (SPND). We only sold BankFirst to allocate to other ECIP recipients we believe were more attractive. We added to Citizens Bankshares (CZBS), PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market increased in the quarter, primarily due to the share price increase of PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of them when they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 29% of the fund. As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 29% of the fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 75% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is about 11% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is 7% of the fund and Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG), which is neither an oil company nor a mortgage company, is nearly 4% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter (link). We will discuss PD-Rx more below. During the fourth quarter we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific Coast Oil Trust. We subsequently added a private investor and Evergreen Capital, who owns 8.5% of the units, to the group bringing it to over 21% of outstanding units. We have called for a Special Meeting to remove the Trustee. We think that the operator, PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust. ARO’s are the cost to return a well back to normal state (i.e., plugging well and removal of equipment, etc.). PCEC contends the Conveyance Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22 (l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement forbids any assessment of costs incurred or accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern what pages 7 and 22 refer to) and secondarily that the proforma financials in the offering documents clearly show the liability remaining with PCEC (see the Offering documents page PCEC F-30 asset retirement obligation line). Meaning it did not transfer to the Trust. 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation when it purchased additional properties in 2008,3 evaluated it annually, and made adjustments accordingly, prior to the trust being created in 2012. At that time, April 2012, the ARO was approximately $22.3 million4 and should have accreted (compounded) at approximately a 7 to 9% rate annually. After ten years of accretion, it would be nearly double the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the amount the operator says the assessed ARO obligation was. Further, in all the Offering document proformas no assessment was made to the trust for asset retirement obligations, nor was the Trust assessed any ARO obligation from 2012 through 2019 when, interestingly enough, PCEC was purchased by new owners. Our argument is that the ARO should not have been assessed to the Trust (unitholders) at all. Thus, all the funds that have been withheld need to be repaid with interest. If true, the operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or $0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its current $17 million market cap and $0.44 per unit price, and distributions would resume at approximately $.023 per unit per month, or $0.28 annually.5 We think fair value of the units would be in excess of $2.00 per unit under this scenario, or five times the current price. What if courts disagreed that the ARO was assessable? Would it be fully assessable or partially? We contend that it is clear in the conveyance agreement that the Trust can only be assessed costs related to production during its existence, not production that pre-dates the creation of the trust or future production. That would mean the ARO cost has to be allocated to production units since PCEC, the operator, purchased the fields, and only the portion related to the time the Trust has been a recipient of cash flows is assessable to the Trust. This would still mean excess funds have been withheld and would be returned and distributions would resume. Under this scenario, we think fair value would be above $1.25 per unit, or nearly three times the current price. We also believe that the funds should be escrowed since if any of the properties/fields were sold, the ARO transfers to the buyer, thus releasing the obligation. Further we contend that the funds withheld should be credited the discount rate, currently 9%, used in the ARO calculation to avoid double assessment. In other words, the amount that has been paid is the present value of future costs discounted back to the present. It would be double assessment to then assess the increase in the present value due to time to the Trust. Since the amount is pre-paid the obligation to earn the discount rate should be borne by the operator. Obviously, there is some chance that the courts deem the ARO fully assessable, ignore our calling of a Special Meeting, and allow the Trustee to proceed to an auction since the Trust did not receive the minimum required distributions from PCEC in 2020 and 2021. A strong case can be made that an auction of the properties is clearly a sale and that the ARO obligation transfers to the buyer and the withheld ARO must be paid back to the Trust with interest along with any proceeds from the auction. Even if that argument was rejected, then the near full payment of the ARO obligation means that cash flows would resume in six months from today and in even less time by the time any auction closed. While the buyer 3 See PCEC page F-9 on initial S-1 filing for purchase allocation and Note 7 on PCEC F-20,21 for ARO changes: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1538822/000119312512005276/d273119ds1.htm#toc273119_23 It is our understanding that the West Pico and Sawtell properties were purchased in 1992. 4 The $22.3 million is actually the December 2011 amount. The amount should have accreted by the 7% discount rate through March 31, 2012 plus any other revisions. We have not seen publicly reported amount for March 31,2012. 5 We are aware that the local refinery is closing in early 2023 and recognize that the Trust may have to pay its share to temporarily truck its oil to refineries further away while it builds a pipeline to connect to the major pipeline nearby. The cost of the pipeline could result in the temporary loss of one or two quarters worth of payments. has to assess the attractiveness of working with PCEC, we still think fair value is above the current price and likely above $1.00 per unit since the ARO obligation would have been paid and monthly distributions resume. While there are a wide range of possible outcomes, we are optimistic that most, if not all, of the ARO that has been assessed is improper. If we are correct, the potential Bonanza scenario we described in our 2022 Q2 letter is more likely. As we said before, time will tell. We added to the position during the quarter. Update on Top Ten Portfolio Holdings as of December 2022 Top 10 Holdings start of 2022 end of 2022 1 Solitron Devices 1 M&F Bancorp 2 PharmChem 2 Solitron Devices 3 Nocopi Technologies 3 Citizens Bankshares 4 BM Technologies 4 PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals 5 PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals 5 Pacific Coast Oil Trust 6 CompuMed 6 Tix Corp (private) 7 CCUR 7 Mortgage Oil 8 Mortgage Oil 8 PharmChem 9 P10 Holdings 9 BM Technologies 10 Western Capital Resources 10 Dyna Group During 2022 we exited Nocopi Technologies (NNUP), CCUR (CCUR) and P10 Holdings (PX). We added M&F Bancorp (MFBP) and Citizens Bankshares (CZBS) as part of our ECIP play. We also added Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), although we had owned it in 2021, but stupidly sold for a modest gain. We also made a private investment joining with Bandera Partners, a private investor, and HSB Capital in buying Tix Corp out of bankruptcy. Below is an update on the larger holdings of the fund: M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares outstanding. In the summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program. The stock is currently at $26 per share. Our cost basis is under $12. In the third quarter M&F earned $0.51 per share. Most of the ECIP funds appear to have still been in cash, likely earning 2% max. Annualizing third quarter earnings gives a $2.05 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to have continued to grow in the fourth quarter on the assumption that some of the cash would have been moved to higher yielding short-term treasuries and some of their loan portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates increasing due to the prime rate being higher) faster than their cost of deposits has increased. A buyer today is paying 11-12 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings double or potentially triple from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by attracting deposits and making loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more detailed discussion of ECIP recipient banks.) Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 21% in 2022 from $11.00 per share to $8.70 at year end. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron due to a proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting was held in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related to the U.S stockpile program, which noted. In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill. Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending, including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The increased stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to add approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024 and running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024. Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows the significance of a $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted Solitron’s cost savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end of the fiscal second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were recipients of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar characteristics as M&F. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded last at $31 per share. The fund started buying in June at $12 per share, which was less half of common book value, and six times 2021 earnings. Our basis is under $18. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 were about $1.27 per share, giving an annualized rate of over $5 per share. Earnings increased due to a chunk of the ECIP funds being invested in US Treasuries during the quarter. Citizens still had a high amount of cash on its balance sheet as of September 30 and likely increased its securities portfolio in the fourth quarter, further boosting earnings. Assuming a $5 to $6 annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple around 5-6 times. Over time the capital should move from being in 4% treasuries to being leveraged via growing deposits and loans or securities, which will boost earnings further, or Citizens can use the funds to buy another bank and increase earnings that way. Without an acquisition we think the bank can earn $7 per share in 2024 and in excess of $8 per share in 2025. An acquisition would likely speed that timetable up. During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment by TD Bank. Details on the rate were not announced, but we would assume it was favorable as Citizens didn’t really need the capital. Our guess is the rate is around 2% and may have a share of future dividend increases. PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is an expert market stock that has historically released financials yearly on its website. The company manufactures both brand and generic pharmaceuticals from its Oklahoma City facility. The company had been profitable until fiscal 2019 and 2020, when it incurred small losses. They adopted a cost cutting program. In fiscal 2021 they returned to profitability earning roughly $0.40 per share excluding PPP loan forgiveness. Net cash was $1.69 per share. Through November 2022 we steadily increased our ownership as shares were available at prices between $3.05 and $3.60 per share (we assumed we were paying 3-4 times earnings net of cash). In late December 2022 they reported fiscal 2022 results. After results, the stock jumped to $6.00 per share and we continued to purchase. We marked the position at $6.00 per share, which was the last market transaction. For the year ended June 30, 2022, PD-Rx had earnings of $1.83 per share. Book value increased to $6.90 per share. They have no debt, and net cash of $3.33 per share. In addition to the cash, their $4.46 million of receivables is more than double total liabilities. At $6.00 per share we are paying 3.5 times trailing earnings and only 1.5 times trailing earnings net of cash. There was nothing in their annual results or management letter that would lead us to believe that earnings will change in the current year versus the prior year. We think PD-Rx can earn $2.00 per share in fiscal 2023 by just investing a portion of their cash in treasuries. While we would love to own the whole business at $6 per share, we are happy to own a part at that price. If earnings in fiscal 2023 are similar to fiscal 2022 results, then book value as of December 2022 is already at $8 per share. We estimate value based on earnings (free cash flow), not book value, and think the company could easily fetch $20 per share in a sale, and likely above $25. We had seen a few years ago that someone who spoke with management had commented that management said they would sell for 1.5x sales which would be over $26 per share. That seemed high at the time, but not at current earnings levels. All but one person in senior management is above 70 years of age, so a sale may well happen over the next few years. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) was discussed above. Tix Corporation (private) – was a company we previously owned shares in when it was public. The company sells show tickets in Las Vegas. It fell upon hard times during COVID and filed for bankruptcy. It re-opened in the fall of 2021 with three locations on the strip. We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a private investor to bid on the company and were the high bidder. The investment was less than ten percent of the fund’s assets. As of year end it was just over 6% of the fund, and that was after marking it down 20% during the year to reflect performance of the business and general economic and stock market conditions. The business has high fixed costs due to rents along the strip being extremely high. Once fixed costs are covered incremental margins are very attractive. Currently Tix is losing money in the slow months and making money in the busier months. We are adding an additional location this spring and working toward adding online sales in the latter half of the year. Online sales should have a different profitability profile due to the absence of rent and most of the labor and replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at the physical locations. It is still too early to know how well the investment will turn out. Shows are still trying to stick with full cost pricing, a significant departure from the pre-Covid higher volume discount approach, which is a concern. Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG) is also presently trading on the expert market. We covered it in more detail in our Q2 2021 letter. It once went nine years without a published trade. It has only 40,915 shares outstanding. Last trade was at $355.00 per share. They do not invest in oil or mortgages, rather real estate, primarily multi-family and some commercial. We bought almost 2% of the company in an hour in May 2021. Current yield is 4.2% based on yearly $15 dividend. The properties have been on the books long enough their tax basis is negative. That likely means there is potential for gains on sale or distributions via refinancing should rates come back down. Recent distributions from real estate holdings to the company have been roughly $20 per share annually. In addition, cash and securities were $118 per share as of June 2021. We haven’t seen financials since that time. For some reason there is no balance sheet liability accrual for taxes on unrealized gains on marketable securities. We expect the stock to be a long-term holding that can give us real estate exposure and generate double digit returns. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000. If this letter was passed on to you and you would like to be added to our monthly distribution list, please email me at the email address below. You can find more letters at eriksencapitalmgmt.com/investor-letters. Should you have any questions regarding the fund, please don’t hesitate to call or email.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
2022 was a difficult year for both stock and bond markets due to rising interest rates.
Growth stocks were hit the hardest, with the NASDAQ declining by 33% on the year. The
best performing index we compare against, was the DJIA, which, thanks to a strong fourth
quarter, declined by only 7% on the year. Cedar Creek increased by 6.2% in the fourth
quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was up 8.8% in 2022, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 17 year history is 14.2%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 848.4%, net of fees and expenses.

* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $948,418
as of December 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $255,713 in the Russell
Micro Cap and $451,810 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of December 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading
at less than 6 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 4.5 times
expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book
was 1.3. Dividend yield was 0.9%. Weighted return on equity as of December 31, 2022
was 22%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 4% and ended the year at 6%. We made minor
changes to the portfolio during the quarter, exiting small positions like bebe stores
(BEBE), Butler National (BUKS), BankFirst (BFCC), Sonics & Materials (SIMA) and
Spindletop (SPND). We only sold BankFirst to allocate to other ECIP recipients we believe
were more attractive. We added to Citizens Bankshares (CZBS), PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL).
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market increased in the quarter, primarily due
to the share price increase of PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). Expert market stocks are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the
buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of them when
they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 29% of the fund.
As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 29% of the
fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 75% of the amount – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is about 11% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL) is 7% of the fund and Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG), which is neither an oil
company nor a mortgage company, is nearly 4% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter,
and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter (link). We will discuss PD-Rx more below.
During the fourth quarter we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific
Coast Oil Trust. We subsequently added a private investor and Evergreen Capital, who
owns 8.5% of the units, to the group bringing it to over 21% of outstanding units. We
have called for a Special Meeting to remove the Trustee. We think that the operator,
PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust.
ARO’s are the cost to return a well back to normal state (i.e., plugging well and removal of
equipment, etc.). PCEC contends the Conveyance Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22
(l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement forbids any assessment of costs incurred
or accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern what pages 7 and 22 refer to)
and secondarily that the proforma financials in the offering documents clearly show the
liability remaining with PCEC (see the Offering documents page PCEC F-30 asset retirement
obligation line). Meaning it did not transfer to the Trust.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation when it purchased additional properties in
2008,3 evaluated it annually, and made adjustments accordingly, prior to the trust being
created in 2012. At that time, April 2012, the ARO was approximately $22.3 million4 and
should have accreted (compounded) at approximately a 7 to 9% rate annually. After ten
years of accretion, it would be nearly double the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the
amount the operator says the assessed ARO obligation was. Further, in all the Offering
document proformas no assessment was made to the trust for asset retirement obligations,
nor was the Trust assessed any ARO obligation from 2012 through 2019 when, interestingly
enough, PCEC was purchased by new owners.
Our argument is that the ARO should not have been assessed to the Trust (unitholders) at
all. Thus, all the funds that have been withheld need to be repaid with interest. If true, the
operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or $0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its
current $17 million market cap and $0.44 per unit price, and distributions would resume at
approximately $.023 per unit per month, or $0.28 annually.5 We think fair value of the
units would be in excess of $2.00 per unit under this scenario, or five times the current
price.
What if courts disagreed that the ARO was assessable? Would it be fully assessable or
partially? We contend that it is clear in the conveyance agreement that the Trust can only
be assessed costs related to production during its existence, not production that pre-dates
the creation of the trust or future production. That would mean the ARO cost has to be
allocated to production units since PCEC, the operator, purchased the fields, and only the
portion related to the time the Trust has been a recipient of cash flows is assessable to the
Trust. This would still mean excess funds have been withheld and would be returned and
distributions would resume. Under this scenario, we think fair value would be above $1.25
per unit, or nearly three times the current price.
We also believe that the funds should be escrowed since if any of the properties/fields were
sold, the ARO transfers to the buyer, thus releasing the obligation. Further we contend that
the funds withheld should be credited the discount rate, currently 9%, used in the ARO
calculation to avoid double assessment. In other words, the amount that has been paid is
the present value of future costs discounted back to the present. It would be double
assessment to then assess the increase in the present value due to time to the Trust. Since
the amount is pre-paid the obligation to earn the discount rate should be borne by the
operator.
Obviously, there is some chance that the courts deem the ARO fully assessable, ignore our
calling of a Special Meeting, and allow the Trustee to proceed to an auction since the Trust
did not receive the minimum required distributions from PCEC in 2020 and 2021. A strong
case can be made that an auction of the properties is clearly a sale and that the ARO
obligation transfers to the buyer and the withheld ARO must be paid back to the Trust with
interest along with any proceeds from the auction. Even if that argument was rejected,
then the near full payment of the ARO obligation means that cash flows would resume in six
months from today and in even less time by the time any auction closed. While the buyer

understanding that the West Pico and Sawtell properties were purchased in 1992.
4 The $22.3 million is actually the December 2011 amount. The amount should have accreted by the 7% discount
rate through March 31, 2012 plus any other revisions. We have not seen publicly reported amount for March
31,2012.
5 We are aware that the local refinery is closing in early 2023 and recognize that the Trust may have to pay its share
to temporarily truck its oil to refineries further away while it builds a pipeline to connect to the major pipeline
nearby. The cost of the pipeline could result in the temporary loss of one or two quarters worth of payments.

has to assess the attractiveness of working with PCEC, we still think fair value is above the
current price and likely above $1.00 per unit since the ARO obligation would have been paid
and monthly distributions resume.
While there are a wide range of possible outcomes, we are optimistic that most, if not all, of
the ARO that has been assessed is improper. If we are correct, the potential Bonanza
scenario we described in our 2022 Q2 letter is more likely. As we said before, time will tell.
We added to the position during the quarter.
Update on Top Ten Portfolio Holdings as of December 2022
Top 10 Holdings

During 2022 we exited Nocopi Technologies (NNUP), CCUR (CCUR) and P10 Holdings
(PX). We added M&F Bancorp (MFBP) and Citizens Bankshares (CZBS) as part of our
ECIP play. We also added Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL), although we had owned it in
2021, but stupidly sold for a modest gain. We also made a private investment joining with
Bandera Partners, a private investor, and HSB Capital in buying Tix Corp out of bankruptcy.
Below is an update on the larger holdings of the fund:
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) - is a North Carolina based bank with two million shares
outstanding. In the summer it received $80 million of low-cost capital through the US
Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program. The stock is currently at $26 per
share. Our cost basis is under $12. In the third quarter M&F earned $0.51 per share. Most
of the ECIP funds appear to have still been in cash, likely earning 2% max. Annualizing
third quarter earnings gives a $2.05 per share earnings run rate. We expect earnings to
have continued to grow in the fourth quarter on the assumption that some of the cash
would have been moved to higher yielding short-term treasuries and some of their loan
portfolio re-pricing (i.e., existing loan rates increasing due to the prime rate being higher)
faster than their cost of deposits has increased.
A buyer today is paying 11-12 times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings
double or potentially triple from an acquisition using the ECIP funds or steadily grow by
attracting deposits and making loans. (See our 2022 third quarter letter for a more
detailed discussion of ECIP recipient banks.)
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares decreased by 21% in 2022 from $11.00
per share to $8.70 at year end. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron due to a
proxy fight in 2015 and management change in 2016. Solitron’s annual meeting was held

in January 2023 and I discussed the press release issued by the company related to the U.S
stockpile program, which noted.
In December 2022 the President signed the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.
Included in the bill (was) appropriations to replenish supplies used in Ukraine and
to increase stockpiles. A number of programs are included in the spending,
including two that represent Solitron‘s two largest revenue sources. The
increased stockpiles program is a multi-year program that we currently expect to
add approximately $20 million in total revenues starting in late (calendar) 2024
and running through 2028, or approximately $4 million annually. Actual contract
awards are expected to occur by the fall of 2024.
Fiscal 2022 revenues were $12.3 million versus the prior years $10.5 million, which shows
the significance of a $4 million annual increase. The press release also noted Solitron’s cost
savings program is achieving or exceeding its targets. In addition, at the end of the fiscal
second quarter and first part of the fiscal third quarter Solitron purchased 1.1% and 1.5%,
respectively, of the outstanding shares of two small community banks that were recipients
of the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP).
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar
characteristics as M&F. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded
last at $31 per share. The fund started buying in June at $12 per share, which was less
half of common book value, and six times 2021 earnings. Our basis is under $18. Citizens
received $95.7 million of additional capital (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. Citizens does
not report quarterly earnings, but the bank does file quarterly Call Reports which are
available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 were about $1.27 per
share, giving an annualized rate of over $5 per share. Earnings increased due to a chunk of
the ECIP funds being invested in US Treasuries during the quarter.
Citizens still had a high amount of cash on its balance sheet as of September 30 and likely
increased its securities portfolio in the fourth quarter, further boosting earnings. Assuming
a $5 to $6 annual run rate in earnings, Citizens is trading at a multiple around 5-6 times.
Over time the capital should move from being in 4% treasuries to being leveraged via
growing deposits and loans or securities, which will boost earnings further, or Citizens can
use the funds to buy another bank and increase earnings that way. Without an acquisition
we think the bank can earn $7 per share in 2024 and in excess of $8 per share in 2025. An
acquisition would likely speed that timetable up.
During the fourth quarter Citizens announced receipt of a $5 million preferred investment
by TD Bank. Details on the rate were not announced, but we would assume it was
favorable as Citizens didn’t really need the capital. Our guess is the rate is around 2% and
may have a share of future dividend increases.
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is an expert market stock that has historically released
financials yearly on its website. The company manufactures both brand and generic
pharmaceuticals from its Oklahoma City facility. The company had been profitable until
fiscal 2019 and 2020, when it incurred small losses. They adopted a cost cutting program.
In fiscal 2021 they returned to profitability earning roughly $0.40 per share excluding PPP
loan forgiveness. Net cash was $1.69 per share. Through November 2022 we steadily
increased our ownership as shares were available at prices between $3.05 and $3.60 per
share (we assumed we were paying 3-4 times earnings net of cash). In late December
2022 they reported fiscal 2022 results. After results, the stock jumped to $6.00 per share
and we continued to purchase. We marked the position at $6.00 per share, which was the
last market transaction. For the year ended June 30, 2022, PD-Rx had earnings of $1.83

per share. Book value increased to $6.90 per share. They have no debt, and net cash of
$3.33 per share. In addition to the cash, their $4.46 million of receivables is more than
double total liabilities.
At $6.00 per share we are paying 3.5 times trailing earnings and only 1.5 times trailing
earnings net of cash. There was nothing in their annual results or management letter that
would lead us to believe that earnings will change in the current year versus the prior year.
We think PD-Rx can earn $2.00 per share in fiscal 2023 by just investing a portion of their
cash in treasuries. While we would love to own the whole business at $6 per share, we are
happy to own a part at that price. If earnings in fiscal 2023 are similar to fiscal 2022
results, then book value as of December 2022 is already at $8 per share. We estimate
value based on earnings (free cash flow), not book value, and think the company could
easily fetch $20 per share in a sale, and likely above $25. We had seen a few years ago
that someone who spoke with management had commented that management said they
would sell for 1.5x sales which would be over $26 per share. That seemed high at the time,
but not at current earnings levels. All but one person in senior management is above 70
years of age, so a sale may well happen over the next few years.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) was discussed above.
Tix Corporation (private) – was a company we previously owned shares in when it was
public. The company sells show tickets in Las Vegas. It fell upon hard times during COVID
and filed for bankruptcy. It re-opened in the fall of 2021 with three locations on the strip.
We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a
private investor to bid on the company and were the high bidder. The investment was less
than ten percent of the fund’s assets. As of year end it was just over 6% of the fund, and
that was after marking it down 20% during the year to reflect performance of the business
and general economic and stock market conditions.
The business has high fixed costs due to rents along the strip being extremely high. Once
fixed costs are covered incremental margins are very attractive. Currently Tix is losing
money in the slow months and making money in the busier months. We are adding an
additional location this spring and working toward adding online sales in the latter half of
the year. Online sales should have a different profitability profile due to the absence of rent
and most of the labor and replacing it with IT costs, some of which is already necessary at
the physical locations. It is still too early to know how well the investment will turn out.
Shows are still trying to stick with full cost pricing, a significant departure from the pre-
Covid higher volume discount approach, which is a concern.
Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG) is also presently trading on the expert market. We
covered it in more detail in our Q2 2021 letter. It once went nine years without a published
trade. It has only 40,915 shares outstanding. Last trade was at $355.00 per share. They
do not invest in oil or mortgages, rather real estate, primarily multi-family and some
commercial. We bought almost 2% of the company in an hour in May 2021. Current yield
is 4.2% based on yearly $15 dividend. The properties have been on the books long enough
their tax basis is negative. That likely means there is potential for gains on sale or
distributions via refinancing should rates come back down. Recent distributions from real
estate holdings to the company have been roughly $20 per share annually. In addition,
cash and securities were $118 per share as of June 2021. We haven’t seen financials since
that time. For some reason there is no balance sheet liability accrual for taxes on unrealized
gains on marketable securities. We expect the stock to be a long-term holding that can
give us real estate exposure and generate double digit returns.

Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider
referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are
1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high
net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

This device is used in conjunction with a water-level regulator to maintain the pressure and water level within the boiler. It’s a small component of a much larger system, but it does an important job—too little water within a boiler can cause the unit to overheat, which, when additional water is subsequently introduced, is a common recipe for an explosion.

What a market turnaround this quarter saw. Spurred by a change in tone from the Federal Reserve, small-cap stocks snapped out of their doldrums and roared 22% higher in November and December. What had been another miserable year for small-cap and micro-cap stocks turned into a good one. Our portfolio tends to lag when markets make big moves in either direction and this quarter was no exception. Still, because the fund had been tracking well ahead of benchmarks through October, we ended up with a satisfactory result this year, ahead of the micro-cap index and just behind small-caps.

I hope when all is said and done, I will have largely resisted the temptation to comment on topics where I have no special expertise or understanding. So, I will confine my observations to this: the return of meaningful interest rates had a sobering effect on investors in 2023. With cash and high-quality bonds once again offering a reasonable return, the allure of speculative cash-burning companies was diminished. The casino grew quieter and this was a good thing. However, now that the Federal Reserve appears to be finished with its aggressive series of rate hikes, the casino appears to be livening up once more. Let the players play. If people want to go back to paying >10x revenues for software companies of dubious quality, I wish them luck. Alluvial will stick to buying shares in cash generating companies at large discounts to a conservative estimate of fair value. Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3 In the quarter, we invested in a highly attractive spin-off security: Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP). The word “office” is enough to give many investors chills, and that’s why the opportunity existed in the first place and continues to exist. Fortunately, the overwhelming pessimism allowed us to build a large position at a very attractive price. It’s no secret that offices as an asset class are under pressure. Work-from-home policies are putting downward pressure on rents and occupancy, with many companies opting for less space as leases expire. Some REITs, eager to avoid the stigma of office ownership, have chosen to dispose of their office properties however they can. REIT W.P. Carey elected to spin off a hodgepodge of office assets as Net Lease Office Properties. The spin-off was tiny, taxable, and stuffed full of assets about as popular as the flu, so it’s no surprise it landed with a thud. Shares of NLOP traded as low as $11 in the first days of trading. We began accumulating shares around $13 and continued to buy as they rose into the upper teens. Even now, as shares hover around $24, I continue to believe NLOP remains very much undervalued. When I called NLOP a “hodgepodge of office assets”, I meant it. The REIT owns everything from quality buildings on 10-15+ year leases to marginal properties on short-term leases that must soon be repositioned or redeveloped. Geographic and industry diversification is good, with no exposure to the most challenged office markets. At $24, NLOP trades at $103 per square foot of leasable space, a large discount to a highly conservative estimate of market value. This discount makes for a potentially interesting investment, but my favorite part of the TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 12/31/23 (%) story here is the built-in catalyst: NLOP was Net Lease Office Properties 7.3 designed to liquidate from the get-go. This REIT is too small to attract a large base of P10 Inc. 6.9 investors and its property holdings are too Fitlife Brands Inc. 5.8 scattershot to pursue a coherent strategy. The registration document puts it plainly, ECIP Bank Basket 5.0 stating that Net Lease Office Properties Unidata S.p.A. 5.0 would “…seek to maximize shareholder value through dispositions of high-quality office Crawford United Corp. 4.5 properties…” Logistec Corp. 4.3 The liquidation process is off to a good start. Rand Worldwide Inc. 3.9 In late December, the company sold off four Seneca Foods Corp. 3.8 of its initial 59 properties, and at very good prices. Two properties with solid, long-term EACO Corp. 3.5 leases were sold at an average of $170 Total, Top Ten 50.0% per square foot while two properties with expiring leases sold for $87 per square foot. NLOP applied the proceeds of the property sales toward its debt, which I must point out is both high-cost and substantial. The good news is this debt will be reduced rapidly from a combination of robust cash flow from the property portfolio and continued asset sales. Debt reduction will allow more and more cash flow to accrete to shareholders. With so many different assets and an office market in flux, its best to be conservative on NLOP’s valuation, but I am very comfortable using a Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4 figure of $130 per square foot to value the company’s 8.4 million square feet of leasable space. Net of debt, that comes out to around $38 per share. I see upside to this valuation if NLOP can continue selling its well-leased properties at $170/square foot or higher, and its “fixer-uppers” at $75/square foot or better. I am happy to hold our NLOP shares until we achieve a price much closer to liquidation value. I should note that our investment in Net Lease Office Properties may be volatile. Shares may bounce around considerably on changes in economic sentiment, the direction of interest rates, and investor enthusiasm (or the lack thereof) around the office market. I consider the significant upside potential well worth the volatility. I remain enthusiastic about another large holding of ours, FitLife Brands. Last I reported, FitLife had just closed on its acquisition of the assets of MusclePharm, a once high-flying exercise supplements brand that been mismanaged into bankruptcy. The potential synergies for FitLife and MusclePharm were obvious, with FitLife able to use its existing manufacturing relationships to create the product and then leverage its strong online channels to offer the product to customers. One of FitLife’s first tasks is to convince online retailers that previously stocked MusclePharm products to do so again. While FitLife has yet to report fourth quarter results, it appears progress is being made. Retailer iHerb.com, once a significant seller, now indicates MusclePharm products are “coming soon.” FitLife shares have performed well. The market is giving the company credit for its successes in acquiring choice assets out of bankruptcy and optimizing them. I don’t think the company is anywhere close to running out of opportunities. Crawford United gave us some good news, authorizing a buyback of up to 300,000 shares, or 8.5% of the total outstanding. Shares performed well in 2023 as the previous year’s motivated seller quit flooding the market with shares. Still, Crawford United trades at only around 8x earnings despite a strong earnings trajectory and the lowest debt in several quarters. Following the buyback authorization, shares jumped from the high $20s into the low $30s. Sometimes all it takes to catalyze a reaction in a stock is management communicating to the market that it thinks shares are cheap and it is willing to do something about it. It really is that simple. Just after year- end, Crawford United announced its first acquisition in a while, paying $7 million to buy Heany Industries, a 92-year-old provider of industrial coatings and ceramics, mainly to the aerospace industry. Depending on how Crawford chose to finance the deal and the earnings multiple they paid, I think the acquisition could increase cash earnings by 25 cents per share. Another recent addition to our portfolio is MRC Global, a distributor to oil & gas drillers, natural gas utilities, and other industries—think fittings, valves, pipes, and the like. MRC is an “ok” business—neither wonderful nor terrible, but simply boring and profitable. It is exposed to the ups and downs of the oil & gas market, but it has made strides to diversify its business into other, less cyclical markets. Most importantly, MRC has an unimpressive track record as a public company and some unhappy owners, and for those reasons I believe the company will be sold. MRC Global’s history stretches back to its founding in 1921, as McJunkin Supply Company. The company would enjoy several decades of prosperity, culminating in a large investment from Goldman Sachs in 2006. Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, Goldman renamed the Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5 company “MRC Global”, took it public in 2012, and then sold its remaining MRC shares the following year. This exit was well-timed, as MRC shares soon began a long decline, driven by a combination of inopportune investments and excess financial leverage. In 2015, urgently needing capital, the company turned to respected dealmaker Henry Cornell, a Goldman alum who was instrumental in MRC’s creation. Cornell Capital put up $363 million to buy convertible preferred stock and MRC used the fresh capital to pay down debt and restore its firepower for additional acquisitions. Cornell probably expected to earn a good cash yield for a few years, then convert the preferred shares and sell as MRC’s profits recovered and its valuation grew, but the rebound never really came. Following the investment, MRC’s operating income reached only around 1/3 of 2013 levels before another round of write-offs and losses in 2020 as COVID caused energy demand to plummet. Recent results have been better—the company has built a good line of business supplying gas utilities and industrials, and debt has been paid down substantially—but TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/23 (%) MRC has been a disappointment for Cornell United States 68.4 Capital. Eurozone 10.7 Turning to the present, MRC has a term Canada 10.6 loan that comes due in September 2024. The company wants to refinance the loan, Poland 7.1 but Cornell Capital, which clearly wants Denmark 1.9 out of this underwhelming investment, has Other 1.3 blocked its efforts to date, filing a lawsuit claiming MRC must seek Cornell’s consent Total 100% on the terms of the new debt. MRC expects to be able to pay off the term loan by drawing on its asset-backed line of credit, but this is a less than ideal solution. Enter activist Engine Capital, owner of 4% of MRC Global shares. Engine Capital has called for MRC Global to seek a sale, arguing it is the best way to cash out Cornell Capital and achieve a satisfactory result for all shareholders. In Engine’s view, MRC’s expressed strategy of continued mergers and acquisitions is unfeasible given the risks of ongoing litigation with Cornell Capital and MRC’s high cost of capital. I wholeheartedly agree. On October 30, Bloomberg reported that MRC Global is working with financial advisors to explore a sale. If MRC Global is sold, I believe it could fetch a price in the mid- to-high teens. To recap: MRC’s biggest capital provider is unhappy; an activist is unhappy; long-term shareholders likely are too, having lost half their investment since the IPO; and management can’t be having much fun either with the headache of litigation and the looming term loan maturity. Something has to give, and I believe it will be MRC Global’s existence as an independent public company. We continue to hold our investments in various banks, the largest being United Bancorporation of Alabama and BankFirst Capital Corporation. Both are recipients of cheap permanent capital from the US Treasury, and both were strongly profitable in 2023 despite the challenging backdrop of rapidly increasing interest rates and deposit costs. Each bank trades at a mid-single digit multiple of earnings, and each is poised to increase these earnings in 2024. The two banks are pursuing Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6 different strategies with BankFirst focused on growth by acquisition and United Bancorporation of Alabama focused on profitable niche lending and services, but both are cheap and well-run institutions. I think an uplisting to the NASDAQ is in the cards for each within a few years. The fund also owns a variety of community banks with extremely illiquid shares, some of them traded on the expert market. These banks are among the cheapest securities I can find, with many trading at some combination of price-to-earnings multiples under 5, less than 60% of tangible book value, or sustainable double-digit dividend yields. Some of these shares may go nowhere for quite some time, but I see value in owning them as long as the underlying banks produce reasonable returns on equity and TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 12/31/23 (%) maintain high lending standards. As long Financials 17.7 as tangible book value per share grows at a Industrials 15.2 healthy pace, shareholders will earn a nice return when these banks are acquired or Information Technology 15.1 their shares become more liquid as the bank Consumer Staples 12.0 grows. Communications 9.7 It’s strange to think that just six or so months Real Estate 9.5 ago, many were predicting calamity for the banking sector based on the high- Consumer Discretionary 9.1 profile failures of a few regional institutions. Materials 6.9 According to the doomsayers, deposits would either flee or become unmanageably Energy 4.0 expensive, bank loan books were houses of Health Care 0.9 cards, and growing securities losses would obliterate any remaining equity. And as Utilities 0.0 usual, when “everyone knows” that a sector Total 100% is teetering on the precipice of financial oblivion, that is the time to buy with both hands. Of course, it’s easy to say so with the benefit of hindsight. Alluvial did add to our bank holdings as valuations hit their low points last year, but I wish I had bought even more. LICT Corporation is a long-time Alluvial Fund holding. Shares have moved up and down in recent years, but mostly sideways. LICT continues to make moves, spinning off its Michigan operations, acquiring a Utah telecom, and repurchasing 8.6% of shares outstanding over the last three years, but the stock just won’t head higher and stay there. I think this is the year that changes. Beginning this year, LICT has a major increase in annual federal subsidies heading its way: over $13 million annually for 15 years, or $762 per LICT share. This will result in a major profit uplift. Subsidies included, LICT will be the cheapest public telecom in the United States, trading at only 4.5x 2024 EBITDA. Reasonable, if not a little expensive for a traditional wireline-heavy telecom, but far too cheap for a modern, operation that derives most of its revenue and earnings from broadband services. Seneca Foods has been active. Shares dipped after quarterly results but have since recovered. In November, the company acquired the Green Giant canned vegetables business from B&G Foods. Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7 Seneca was already active in co-manufacturing product for B&G, so this acquisition should result in increased gross profit for Seneca with little incremental investment or expenditure. Besides the B&G Foods assets, Seneca Foods has been very active in repurchasing its own shares, reducing the quantity outstanding by nearly 6% from July through October. I expect to see additional repurchase activity when the company reports in February. Buying back shares while they trade at a mid-single digit multiple of earnings is an excellent use of capital. The Logistec Corporation buyout closed in early January, allowing us to realize a nice gain on that special situation. Our remaining Canadian holdings are Hammond Manufacturing and Supremex Inc., two modestly-valued manufacturers. As the mighty American stock market hits news highs, I think already neglected markets like Canada’s could offer even more mis-priced securities. Fertile grounds for finding opportunities if you don’t mind under-performing in the short run. The fund is currently about 70% allocated toward US holdings, a figure I consider slightly above the long-term target. Though I believe many foreign markets are cheaper than US markets, I keep running across US special situations just too good to ignore. The has caused the breakdown between our US and international holdings to swing toward the US. I expect the pendulum to swing back a bit in 2024. With our seventh year of operations in the books, I want to thank you once again for investing in Alluvial Fund. I started Alluvial in hopes of spotlighting the opportunities in the market’s dustier corners, and thus far, it is working. Markets look a lot different than when Alluvial Fund launched in 2017 and even more different than when I began managing capital a decade ago. There are fewer good quality OTC-traded companies, and fewer small public companies in general. The barriers to researching and investing in foreign companies are lower. It seems these changes should result in fewer opportunities in the market segments where Alluvial focuses, but somehow there is never a shortage of neglected, misunderstood securities here and there around the globe. Thanks to a good start to the year and some new capital from limited partners, Alluvial Fund is at an all-time high both in terms of total returns to LPs and assets under management. I will try with all my might to deliver a good year—a good year for all of us, as the entirety of my money is invested in Alluvial Fund. I hope you are well, and I look forward to reporting to you again a few months from now. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out with questions or comments about the portfolio, or just to catch up. I welcome your calls and e-mails.

Letter to Limited Partners Fourth Quarter 2023

The cover image shows a pump control unit within an industrial boiler. This
device is used in conjunction with a water-level regulator to maintain the
pressure and water level within the boiler. It’s a small component of a much
larger system, but it does an important job—too little water within a boiler
can cause the unit to overheat, which, when additional water is subsequently
introduced, is a common recipe for an explosion.
The equipment in the diagram is from an Oklahoma oil and gas well in the
1930s, and is among the type of equipment historically distributed by Alluvial
Fund holding MRC Global. Read the letter to learn more about MRC.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund returned 3.2% in the fourth quarter, bringing our return to 15.1% for the full year.
What a market turnaround this quarter saw. Spurred by a change in tone from the Federal
Reserve, small-cap stocks snapped out of their doldrums and roared 22% higher in November and
December. What had been another miserable year for small-cap and micro-cap stocks turned into
a good one. Our portfolio tends to lag when markets make big moves in either direction and this
quarter was no exception. Still, because the fund had been tracking well ahead of benchmarks
through October, we ended up with a satisfactory result this year, ahead of the micro-cap index
and just behind small-caps.

I use these letters to update you on developments in the portfolio, attempting to eschew fluff
and avoid pontificating on the economic trends of the day. I hope when all is said and done, I will
have largely resisted the temptation to comment on topics where I have no special expertise or
understanding. So, I will confine my observations to this: the return of meaningful interest rates
had a sobering effect on investors in 2023. With cash and high-quality bonds once again offering
a reasonable return, the allure of speculative cash-burning companies was diminished. The casino
grew quieter and this was a good thing. However, now that the Federal Reserve appears to be
finished with its aggressive series of rate hikes, the casino appears to be livening up once more.
Let the players play. If people want to go back to paying >10x revenues for software companies of
dubious quality, I wish them luck. Alluvial will stick to buying shares in cash generating companies
at large discounts to a conservative estimate of fair value.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

In the quarter, we invested in a highly attractive spin-off security: Net Lease Office Properties
(NLOP). The word “office” is enough to give many investors chills, and that’s why the opportunity
existed in the first place and continues to exist. Fortunately, the overwhelming pessimism allowed
us to build a large position at a very attractive price.
It’s no secret that offices as an asset class are under pressure. Work-from-home policies are putting
downward pressure on rents and occupancy, with many companies opting for less space as leases
expire. Some REITs, eager to avoid the stigma of office ownership, have chosen to dispose of their
office properties however they can. REIT W.P. Carey elected to spin off a hodgepodge of office
assets as Net Lease Office Properties. The spin-off was tiny, taxable, and stuffed full of assets about
as popular as the flu, so it’s no surprise it landed with a thud. Shares of NLOP traded as low as $11
in the first days of trading. We began accumulating shares around $13 and continued to buy as
they rose into the upper teens. Even now, as shares hover around $24, I continue to believe NLOP
remains very much undervalued.
When I called NLOP a “hodgepodge of office assets”, I meant it. The REIT owns everything from
quality buildings on 10-15+ year leases to marginal properties on short-term leases that must
soon be repositioned or redeveloped. Geographic and industry diversification is good, with
no exposure to the most challenged office markets. At $24, NLOP trades at $103 per square
foot of leasable space, a large discount to a highly conservative estimate of market value. This
discount makes for a potentially interesting
investment, but my favorite part of the
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 12/31/23 (%)
story here is the built-in catalyst: NLOP was
Net Lease Office Properties 7.3
designed to liquidate from the get-go. This
REIT is too small to attract a large base of P10 Inc. 6.9
investors and its property holdings are too
Fitlife Brands Inc. 5.8
scattershot to pursue a coherent strategy.
The registration document puts it plainly, ECIP Bank Basket 5.0
stating that Net Lease Office Properties

would “…seek to maximize shareholder value
through dispositions of high-quality office Crawford United Corp. 4.5

Logistec Corp. 4.3
The liquidation process is off to a good start. Rand Worldwide Inc. 3.9
In late December, the company sold off four
Seneca Foods Corp. 3.8
of its initial 59 properties, and at very good
prices. Two properties with solid, long-term EACO Corp. 3.5
leases were sold at an average of $170
Total, Top Ten 50.0%
per square foot while two properties with
expiring leases sold for $87 per square foot.
NLOP applied the proceeds of the property sales toward its debt, which I must point out is both
high-cost and substantial. The good news is this debt will be reduced rapidly from a combination
of robust cash flow from the property portfolio and continued asset sales. Debt reduction will allow
more and more cash flow to accrete to shareholders. With so many different assets and an office
market in flux, its best to be conservative on NLOP’s valuation, but I am very comfortable using a
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

figure of $130 per square foot to value the company’s 8.4 million square feet of leasable space.
Net of debt, that comes out to around $38 per share. I see upside to this valuation if NLOP can
continue selling its well-leased properties at $170/square foot or higher, and its “fixer-uppers”
at $75/square foot or better. I am happy to hold our NLOP shares until we achieve a price much
closer to liquidation value.
I should note that our investment in Net Lease Office Properties may be volatile. Shares may
bounce around considerably on changes in economic sentiment, the direction of interest rates, and
investor enthusiasm (or the lack thereof) around the office market. I consider the significant upside
potential well worth the volatility.
I remain enthusiastic about another large holding of ours, FitLife Brands. Last I reported, FitLife
had just closed on its acquisition of the assets of MusclePharm, a once high-flying exercise
supplements brand that been mismanaged into bankruptcy. The potential synergies for FitLife
and MusclePharm were obvious, with FitLife able to use its existing manufacturing relationships to
create the product and then leverage its strong online channels to offer the product to customers.
One of FitLife’s first tasks is to convince online retailers that previously stocked MusclePharm
products to do so again. While FitLife has yet to report fourth quarter results, it appears progress
is being made. Retailer iHerb.com, once a significant seller, now indicates MusclePharm products
are “coming soon.” FitLife shares have performed well. The market is giving the company credit
for its successes in acquiring choice assets out of bankruptcy and optimizing them. I don’t think the
company is anywhere close to running out of opportunities.
Crawford United gave us some good news, authorizing a buyback of up to 300,000 shares, or
8.5% of the total outstanding. Shares performed well in 2023 as the previous year’s motivated
seller quit flooding the market with shares. Still, Crawford United trades at only around 8x
earnings despite a strong earnings trajectory and the lowest debt in several quarters. Following
the buyback authorization, shares jumped from the high $20s into the low $30s. Sometimes all it
takes to catalyze a reaction in a stock is management communicating to the market that it thinks
shares are cheap and it is willing to do something about it. It really is that simple. Just after year-
end, Crawford United announced its first acquisition in a while, paying $7 million to buy Heany
Industries, a 92-year-old provider of industrial coatings and ceramics, mainly to the aerospace
industry. Depending on how Crawford chose to finance the deal and the earnings multiple they
paid, I think the acquisition could increase cash earnings by 25 cents per share.
Another recent addition to our portfolio is MRC Global, a distributor to oil & gas drillers, natural
gas utilities, and other industries—think fittings, valves, pipes, and the like. MRC is an “ok”
business—neither wonderful nor terrible, but simply boring and profitable. It is exposed to the ups
and downs of the oil & gas market, but it has made strides to diversify its business into other, less
cyclical markets. Most importantly, MRC has an unimpressive track record as a public company and
some unhappy owners, and for those reasons I believe the company will be sold.
MRC Global’s history stretches back to its founding in 1921, as McJunkin Supply Company. The
company would enjoy several decades of prosperity, culminating in a large investment from
Goldman Sachs in 2006. Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, Goldman renamed the
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

company “MRC Global”, took it public in 2012, and then sold its remaining MRC shares the
following year. This exit was well-timed, as MRC shares soon began a long decline, driven by a
combination of inopportune investments and excess financial leverage. In 2015, urgently needing
capital, the company turned to respected dealmaker Henry Cornell, a Goldman alum who was
instrumental in MRC’s creation. Cornell Capital put up $363 million to buy convertible preferred
stock and MRC used the fresh capital to pay down debt and restore its firepower for additional
acquisitions.
Cornell probably expected to earn a good cash yield for a few years, then convert the preferred
shares and sell as MRC’s profits recovered and its valuation grew, but the rebound never really
came. Following the investment, MRC’s operating income reached only around 1/3 of 2013
levels before another round of write-offs and losses in 2020 as COVID caused energy demand
to plummet. Recent results have been better—the company has built a good line of business
supplying gas utilities and industrials, and
debt has been paid down substantially—but TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/23 (%)

on the terms of the new debt. MRC expects
to be able to pay off the term loan by
drawing on its asset-backed line of credit, but this is a less than ideal solution. Enter activist Engine
Capital, owner of 4% of MRC Global shares. Engine Capital has called for MRC Global to seek a
sale, arguing it is the best way to cash out Cornell Capital and achieve a satisfactory result for all
shareholders. In Engine’s view, MRC’s expressed strategy of continued mergers and acquisitions is
unfeasible given the risks of ongoing litigation with Cornell Capital and MRC’s high cost of capital.
I wholeheartedly agree. On October 30, Bloomberg reported that MRC Global is working with
financial advisors to explore a sale. If MRC Global is sold, I believe it could fetch a price in the mid-
to-high teens.
To recap: MRC’s biggest capital provider is unhappy; an activist is unhappy; long-term shareholders
likely are too, having lost half their investment since the IPO; and management can’t be having
much fun either with the headache of litigation and the looming term loan maturity. Something has
to give, and I believe it will be MRC Global’s existence as an independent public company.
We continue to hold our investments in various banks, the largest being United Bancorporation of
Alabama and BankFirst Capital Corporation. Both are recipients of cheap permanent capital from
the US Treasury, and both were strongly profitable in 2023 despite the challenging backdrop of
rapidly increasing interest rates and deposit costs. Each bank trades at a mid-single digit multiple
of earnings, and each is poised to increase these earnings in 2024. The two banks are pursuing
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

different strategies with BankFirst focused on growth by acquisition and United Bancorporation
of Alabama focused on profitable niche lending and services, but both are cheap and well-run
institutions. I think an uplisting to the NASDAQ is in the cards for each within a few years.
The fund also owns a variety of community banks with extremely illiquid shares, some of them
traded on the expert market. These banks are among the cheapest securities I can find, with many
trading at some combination of price-to-earnings multiples under 5, less than 60% of tangible
book value, or sustainable double-digit dividend yields. Some of these shares may go nowhere
for quite some time, but I see value in
owning them as long as the underlying banks
produce reasonable returns on equity and TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 12/31/23 (%)

usual, when “everyone knows” that a sector

is teetering on the precipice of financial
oblivion, that is the time to buy with both
hands. Of course, it’s easy to say so with the benefit of hindsight. Alluvial did add to our bank
holdings as valuations hit their low points last year, but I wish I had bought even more.
LICT Corporation is a long-time Alluvial Fund holding. Shares have moved up and down in recent
years, but mostly sideways. LICT continues to make moves, spinning off its Michigan operations,
acquiring a Utah telecom, and repurchasing 8.6% of shares outstanding over the last three years,
but the stock just won’t head higher and stay there. I think this is the year that changes. Beginning
this year, LICT has a major increase in annual federal subsidies heading its way: over $13 million
annually for 15 years, or $762 per LICT share. This will result in a major profit uplift. Subsidies
included, LICT will be the cheapest public telecom in the United States, trading at only 4.5x 2024
EBITDA. Reasonable, if not a little expensive for a traditional wireline-heavy telecom, but far too
cheap for a modern, operation that derives most of its revenue and earnings from broadband
services.
Seneca Foods has been active. Shares dipped after quarterly results but have since recovered. In
November, the company acquired the Green Giant canned vegetables business from B&G Foods.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

Seneca was already active in co-manufacturing product for B&G, so this acquisition should result
in increased gross profit for Seneca with little incremental investment or expenditure. Besides the
B&G Foods assets, Seneca Foods has been very active in repurchasing its own shares, reducing
the quantity outstanding by nearly 6% from July through October. I expect to see additional
repurchase activity when the company reports in February. Buying back shares while they trade at a
mid-single digit multiple of earnings is an excellent use of capital.
The Logistec Corporation buyout closed in early January, allowing us to realize a nice gain on that
special situation. Our remaining Canadian holdings are Hammond Manufacturing and Supremex
Inc., two modestly-valued manufacturers. As the mighty American stock market hits news highs, I
think already neglected markets like Canada’s could offer even more mis-priced securities. Fertile
grounds for finding opportunities if you don’t mind under-performing in the short run. The fund is
currently about 70% allocated toward US holdings, a figure I consider slightly above the long-term
target. Though I believe many foreign markets are cheaper than US markets, I keep running across
US special situations just too good to ignore. The has caused the breakdown between our US and
international holdings to swing toward the US. I expect the pendulum to swing back a bit in 2024.
With our seventh year of operations in the books, I want to thank you once again for investing in
Alluvial Fund. I started Alluvial in hopes of spotlighting the opportunities in the market’s dustier
corners, and thus far, it is working. Markets look a lot different than when Alluvial Fund launched in
2017 and even more different than when I began managing capital a decade ago. There are fewer
good quality OTC-traded companies, and fewer small public companies in general. The barriers to
researching and investing in foreign companies are lower. It seems these changes should result in
fewer opportunities in the market segments where Alluvial focuses, but somehow there is never a
shortage of neglected, misunderstood securities here and there around the globe.
Thanks to a good start to the year and some new capital from limited partners, Alluvial Fund is
at an all-time high both in terms of total returns to LPs and assets under management. I will try
with all my might to deliver a good year—a good year for all of us, as the entirety of my money
is invested in Alluvial Fund. I hope you are well, and I look forward to reporting to you again a
few months from now. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out with questions or
comments about the portfolio, or just to catch up. I welcome your calls and e-mails.

"Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd.",Daniel S. Loeb,"July 30, 2025",2025.0,2.0,7.5,S&P 500,10.9,-3.4000000000000004,"The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Master Fund LP in a master-feeder structure. Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Master Fund LP inclusive of legacy private investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable. Sector and geographic categories are determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

ANNUALIZED NET Q21 RETURN2 TP OFFSHORE FUND, LTD. 7.5% 13.2% CS HF EVENT-DRIVEN INDEX 3.0% 6.9% S&P 500 INDEX (TR) 10.9% 9.6% MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR) 11.6% 8.1% 1 Through June 30, 2025. 2 Annualized Return from inception (December 1996 for TP Offshore and quoted indices). PLEASE SEE THE NEW SERIES RETURNS AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT. The top five winners for the quarter were Siemens Energy AG, US Steel, TSMC, Nvidia, and Vistra. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding hedges, were Pacific Gas and Electric, Kenvue, a short position, London Stock Exchange Group, and Fortive. Portfolio Updates The Second Quarter began tumultuously, as “Liberation Day” and subsequent forecasts of an imminent recession spooked markets. By the end of the quarter, the market came to see initial tariff proposals as trial balloons and an astute negotiation tactic. Sentiment shifted positively, economic data turned upwards, and favorable AI data points drove a rebound in markets and our portfolio. Opportunistic purchases near market lows and timely covering of our hedges enabled us to capture much of the market rebound. Page 1 Nippon Steel’s takeover of US Steel was the highlight of the quarter, contributing 200bps gross (188bps net) to performance.1 We believe this outsized return opportunity arose from the cross currents of trade policy, industrial policy, and the MAGA agenda that created noise and kept certain investors away from the situation. As we noted in our Q1 letter, we view opportunities in risk arbitrage as compelling right now since active managers have increasingly de-emphasized it as a core investment strategy. In the technology sector, continued consumer and enterprise adoption of AI as well as relentless commitment to AI capex drove further gains. We re-initiated a position in Nvidia, which we believed had sold off sharply due to tariff concerns, recession fears, rack deployment slowdown and increased scrutiny of prospective ROI of new data center capex. In Europe, major shifts underway including developments in European politics, a €1 trillion defense spending bill passed by the German Parliament, and a growing trend of asset flows towards non-dollar markets benefited our European equity investments like Siemens Energy, Rolls Royce, and DSV. Despite elevated market multiples and sustained policy uncertainty, we see an expanding opportunity set and have a steady idea flow of what we believe are digitally savvy, capital efficient, and exceptionally run companies to invest in as we head into the back half of the year. Rocket Companies We initiated a position in Rocket Companies during the Second Quarter based on its transformative all-stock acquisition of Mr. Cooper. Rocket has been a persistent share gainer in the fragmented mortgage origination industry, with a 12% market share of refi 1 This letter includes discussions of certain portfolio investments. These discussions are intended to provide information concerning such investments and to illustrate Third Point’s investment analyses, but they are not necessarily representative of Third Point investments generally or of the overall performance of funds managed by Third Point. Please see page 1 of this letter for overall performance of funds managed by Third Point implementing the flagship strategy for the most recent quarter and since inception. Page 2 originations and a 4% share of purchase originations. It has differentiated, industry-leading cost and time to originate, driven by its continuous reinvestment in technology and automation. While the average originator takes 45 days to close a refi loan, Rocket only takes 20 days – and that key metric continues to fall. In fact, over 50% of loans now close in less than 15 days. Mr. Cooper is the leading mortgage servicer, with 11% market share, making it over 50% larger than its next largest competitor. Much like Rocket in the origination space, Mr. Cooper has industry-leading cost-to-service that has fallen by ~50% over the last five years. These differentiated unit economics have allowed Mr. Cooper to be a primary beneficiary of MSR sales by cash-poor, subscale originators struggling to keep afloat in the current high-rate environment. We view the combination of Rocket and Mr. Cooper as a transformative, synergy-rich merger between two technology leaders in the otherwise parochial and cost inflationary mortgage industry. Combining the largest refi originator with the largest servicer will, we believe, enable pro forma Rocket to turn ecosystem unit economics on its head. Rather than an originator having to reacquire a customer in 5-7 years or a servicer having to reacquire the MSR, Mr. Cooper’s servicing portfolio could feed Rocket’s refi origination machine, leveraging Rocket’s ~85% refi recapture rates which are already >3x the industry average. On top of this compelling combination, enter AI. Rocket has begun to realize the benefits of automating workflows – from income verification to document submission, to credit score verification – in ways that set it apart from others in the industry. De-bottlenecking these monotonous administrative chores should enable the company to improve both throughput (applications processed per officer) and conversion (applications that result in a mortgage) and pass through a portion to the end consumer to drive further market share gains. Casey’s General Stores During the quarter, we continued adding to a new long position in Casey’s General Stores. At ~2,900 locations, Casey’s is the third largest convenience store chain in the US by store Page 3 count. More importantly, it is the fifth largest pizza chain in the country. It is a “boring” business to some, but there is an art to boring – we believe the returns and their consistency have been exceptional and stem from a quirky counter-positioning of the business. When a company chooses not to do the easy thing, it is often a powerful signal that something special is at work. Selling gas and cigarettes is easy. Selling fresh food at scale as successfully as Casey’s is not. Figuring out food creates a powerful feedback loop – Casey’s earns more profit dollars per visit, enabling them to price fuel at a discount to independent gas stations and pizza at a discount to competing QSRs. Consumers save on both purchases, and the result is a brand beloved by a loyal customer base, whose Net Promoter Scores look nothing like the rest of the industry. How has Casey’s solved for food? We attribute their success to differentiated employee retention and approaching the business like a community-centric restaurant that consumers trust to feed their families. Annualized labor churn rates north of 100% have long plagued convenience stores – it is hard to retain employees, let alone incentivize them to sell perishables and run open air kitchens. Not so with Casey’s. Their stores have 40% more staff than your typical gas station and they have used this as an opportunity to offer viable career paths on a store-by-store basis throughout rural America. We have eaten our fair share of Casey’s brisket pizza, and in our store tours we were impressed by the consistency of quality and employee and customer loyalty that they have created at the store level. A recent test roll-out of chicken wings has seen high satisfaction scores and we believe the company is on its way to a system wide rollout of wings that has the potential to meaningfully increase sales densities. Casey’s stock has performed well over the last ten years and is up over 30% this year alone; yet we believe the team from Des Moines is just getting started. The recent acquisition of 200 stores from Fike’s marked their entrance into the South, and management has since commented that Texas alone could offer 2,000 more units (vs. today’s national footprint of 2,900), reinforcing our belief that there are plenty of towns across the South that would love a Casey’s. Page 4 Our expectation is that this unit growth story is likely to play out more quickly than broadly expected given Casey’s demonstrated ability to do accretive M&A. In the Fike’s example, Casey’s paid 11x headline EBITDA, but the pro forma multiple looks more like 7x when pizza is rolled out across the footprint. How many companies have the luxury of replicable, accretive M&A at EBITDA multiples that are half of its own trading levels? In Casey’s we see a world class management team with a differentiated mousetrap and a decade of profitable growth ahead of them – whether they are labeled a restaurant or a gas station or a general store is semantics. As the company’s slogan goes, “It’s Not Crazy, it’s Casey’s!” Informa PLC During the quarter we made a new investment in Informa PLC, the global leader in B2B live events. The company connects buyers and sellers in various industries, enabling business interactions, and disseminating knowledge across verticals. We believe Informa has built a strong, underappreciated moat around its core events business benefiting from network effects, scale, and process power since managing events with tens of thousands of attendees is not an easy endeavor. For example, some trade associations have reported incurring losses on their annual shows, while Informa enjoys ~30% margins. Well-run scale events build a brand and become “must-attend” franchises for industry participants. Informa owns and runs some of the most recognizable events globally, including the Monaco/Ft. Lauderdale Boat Shows, the Dubai Air Show, Cannes Lions, SuperReturn, BlackHat, and Money 20/20. The business has strong visibility and positive working capital dynamics. Often, next year’s iteration of an event will be more than half pre-sold by the end of the current year’s show, giving the company elevated levels of predictability and relatively low cyclicality. Informa has also carved out what we see as a generational opportunity in the Middle East, establishing JVs within both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Attracting business travel is a core priority for both economies, and local governments are investing heavily in event venues Page 5 that will support growth in B2B events for years to come. These JVs also allow Informa to bring new iterations of its existing and successful brands into the Middle East, underscored by Money 20/20 adding a Middle East show in Riyadh this fall. We expect more of Informa’s marquee franchises to expand to the Middle East in short order. One insight we have derived from our investment in Live Nation and have applied here is that in a world that is becoming increasingly more digital, the value of high-quality live events should meaningfully increase to both exhibitors and attendees. We believe the company will accelerate revenue growth, particularly through its Middle East strategy, and compound earnings at a double-digit rate for many years, all while returning meaningful cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and acting as the sole consolidator of the fragmented events industry. Despite these qualities, the stock trades at a mere 14x forward earnings multiple. Corporate Credit Update Third Point corporate credit was up 2.9% gross (2.1% net) for the second quarter, bringing 2025 performance to 3.0% gross (1.8% net). Our year-to-date performance has lagged the ICE BofA US high yield index primarily due to costs associated with hedges made to protect capital during the quarter’s downturn as well as disappointing results from three credits during Q1. We took the opportunity to add exposure to two of the three laggards. Like equities, credit experienced extraordinary volatility during the quarter, with spreads blowing out +100bps in the wake of “Liberation Day”, only to recover quickly. While we have been able to identify opportunities to capitalize on brief credit dislocations in the past, this was over in days and did not reach the levels or liquidity that make committing substantial capital easy. We increased exposure on the back end of the spread spike as the tariff rhetoric dialed down. High yield bond spreads are plumbing the depths of the 2021 record lows, although yields are still +300bps higher, providing some total return support. The real action in the market continues to be in leveraged loans where spreads in CCC names remain close to 1000bps Page 6 over B spreads. These wide spreads reflect the lower quality of the leverage loan universe – defaults (including exchange offers) are running close to 5% – but are also a function of the technical selling pressure created by CLOs. CLOs are highly leveraged structures that buy diversified pools of leveraged loans and have limited baskets to own “CCC” credits. CLOs own approximately 74% of the leveraged loan universe, up from 62% in 2020. Historically leveraged loans were thought to be higher credit quality than high yield bonds since they are typically senior and secured; however, today the reverse is true. That is partially a function of CLO’s large, growing and arguably less discriminating buyer base. When you need to accumulate positions in over one hundred credits in short order, it is inevitable that you do not love every single one. Our team is devoting much of its time combing through this universe and has been able to strengthen our research thanks to the number of leveraged loans in the CLOs of the recently acquired Birch Grove business. While longevity brings about aches and pains, it also aids in one of the most important skills in investing: pattern recognition. In 2014, energy was the largest sector in the high yield market at about 18% and “fracking” dramatically shifted the cost curve for oil and gas production. Not only was credit’s energy sector eviscerated but the malaise spread across the entire credit universe (exacerbated by a slowdown in China) and spreads blew out from about 450bps to over 800bps. In 2016, as markets normalized, our corporate credit book generated a return of 48.7% gross (46.2% net). Today the largest sector of the leveraged loan universe is technology, at about 17%. While a lot remains to be seen about the impact of AI technology on software providers, we believe that, like fracking, AI represents a massive downward shift in the cost curve. In our view, there will doubtless be beneficiaries in the space, but we suspect that it will be a challenging transition for legacy software suppliers, especially highly leveraged ones with a limited ability to reinvest. We are presently underweighting this sector but are spending a lot of time here as there are already a number of stressed/distressed credits. If this unfolds as we think it might, AI might do for credit in 2025/26 what fracking did in 2015/16. Page 7 Structured Credit Update While most market cycles have shortened since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, we believe the snapback after “Liberation Day” across equities and credit was impressively short. In June, we saw the conclusion of an active quarter of trading with a Treasury rally of about 15bps on the 5-Year and investment grade credit spread tightening. As the equity market traded to new highs, we saw three themes emerge. 1. The demand for residential mortgage credit remains strong. New US housing supply remains low and with rates at these levels, we continue to see low housing turnover. House price appreciation is trending towards 4% year-over-year and in our view, that has created a resilient mortgage borrower that wants to hold onto their home given the material amount of home equity. In particular, we have seen that there is a bid for first lien, owner occupied residential mortgages as compared to second-lien loans at 75-80 LTV which are more susceptible to a price correction. As a result, we priced a reperforming mortgage deal in June with the AAA tranche (representing approximately 65% of market value) at a 5.5% yield with over fifteen different investors. As rates potentially decline over the next few quarters, we see the potential for a compelling total return on our mortgage positions as our discount dollar price reperforming loans trade higher with more refinancings. 2. Hedge funds can find alpha in tradeable, liquid securities versus chasing private credit. We have discussed our rental car ABS exposure in the previous letters. In June, we added risk at around 550bps spread or 10% yield. Within three weeks, we saw those spreads tighten to around 475bps, and we have been able to monetize some of the position. Competition amongst large private credit firms has pushed execution on larger blocks of loans to local tights, but, in our estimation our ability to capitalize on dislocations provides compelling returns with increased liquidity. 3. Public companies with structured credit financing who are in distress can create opportunities to source mid- to high-teens returns. In solar loan and lease financing, we have seen multiple companies file for bankruptcy as persistently high rates Page 8 overload their capital structures and business models. These companies originated long duration solar loans at interest rates of 1.99-2.99% and relied on the securitization market to finance these investments at comparably low rates. As rates sold off, the profitability of these assets fell dramatically. The slew of bankruptcy filings has challenged the assumptions of ABS investors, allowing us to source debt tranches at steep discounts of $85 to $60 which to us have the capacity to deliver returns in the mid- to high-teens. While many investors see tightening credit spreads and the equity market at new highs, we are excited by the emerging opportunity set in sectors like rental car ABS, solar ABS and monetizing our reperforming mortgage trade in the coming quarters. Being nimble on trading has enabled us to source sizeable opportunities that seek to generate capital appreciation. Sincerely, Daniel S.

Portfolio Updates
The Second Quarter began tumultuously, as “Liberation Day” and subsequent forecasts of an
imminent recession spooked markets. By the end of the quarter, the market came to see
initial tariff proposals as trial balloons and an astute negotiation tactic. Sentiment shifted
positively, economic data turned upwards, and favorable AI data points drove a rebound in
markets and our portfolio. Opportunistic purchases near market lows and timely covering
of our hedges enabled us to capture much of the market rebound.
Page 1

Nippon Steel’s takeover of US Steel was the highlight of the quarter, contributing 200bps
gross (188bps net) to performance.1 We believe this outsized return opportunity arose from
the cross currents of trade policy, industrial policy, and the MAGA agenda that created noise
and kept certain investors away from the situation. As we noted in our Q1 letter, we view
opportunities in risk arbitrage as compelling right now since active managers have
increasingly de-emphasized it as a core investment strategy.
In the technology sector, continued consumer and enterprise adoption of AI as well as
relentless commitment to AI capex drove further gains. We re-initiated a position in Nvidia,
which we believed had sold off sharply due to tariff concerns, recession fears, rack
deployment slowdown and increased scrutiny of prospective ROI of new data center capex.
In Europe, major shifts underway including developments in European politics, a €1 trillion
defense spending bill passed by the German Parliament, and a growing trend of asset flows
towards non-dollar markets benefited our European equity investments like Siemens
Energy, Rolls Royce, and DSV.
Despite elevated market multiples and sustained policy uncertainty, we see an expanding
opportunity set and have a steady idea flow of what we believe are digitally savvy, capital
efficient, and exceptionally run companies to invest in as we head into the back half of the
year.

originations and a 4% share of purchase originations. It has differentiated, industry-leading
cost and time to originate, driven by its continuous reinvestment in technology and
automation. While the average originator takes 45 days to close a refi loan, Rocket only takes
20 days – and that key metric continues to fall. In fact, over 50% of loans now close in less
than 15 days.
Mr. Cooper is the leading mortgage servicer, with 11% market share, making it over 50%
larger than its next largest competitor. Much like Rocket in the origination space, Mr. Cooper
has industry-leading cost-to-service that has fallen by ~50% over the last five years. These
differentiated unit economics have allowed Mr. Cooper to be a primary beneficiary of MSR
sales by cash-poor, subscale originators struggling to keep afloat in the current high-rate
environment.
We view the combination of Rocket and Mr. Cooper as a transformative, synergy-rich merger
between two technology leaders in the otherwise parochial and cost inflationary mortgage
industry. Combining the largest refi originator with the largest servicer will, we believe,
enable pro forma Rocket to turn ecosystem unit economics on its head. Rather than an
originator having to reacquire a customer in 5-7 years or a servicer having to reacquire the
MSR, Mr. Cooper’s servicing portfolio could feed Rocket’s refi origination machine,
leveraging Rocket’s ~85% refi recapture rates which are already >3x the industry average.
On top of this compelling combination, enter AI. Rocket has begun to realize the benefits of
automating workflows – from income verification to document submission, to credit score
verification – in ways that set it apart from others in the industry. De-bottlenecking these
monotonous administrative chores should enable the company to improve both throughput
(applications processed per officer) and conversion (applications that result in a mortgage)
and pass through a portion to the end consumer to drive further market share gains.
Casey’s General Stores
During the quarter, we continued adding to a new long position in Casey’s General Stores. At
~2,900 locations, Casey’s is the third largest convenience store chain in the US by store

count. More importantly, it is the fifth largest pizza chain in the country. It is a “boring”
business to some, but there is an art to boring – we believe the returns and their consistency
have been exceptional and stem from a quirky counter-positioning of the business. When a
company chooses not to do the easy thing, it is often a powerful signal that something special
is at work. Selling gas and cigarettes is easy. Selling fresh food at scale as successfully as
Casey’s is not. Figuring out food creates a powerful feedback loop – Casey’s earns more profit
dollars per visit, enabling them to price fuel at a discount to independent gas stations and
pizza at a discount to competing QSRs. Consumers save on both purchases, and the result is
a brand beloved by a loyal customer base, whose Net Promoter Scores look nothing like the
rest of the industry.
How has Casey’s solved for food? We attribute their success to differentiated employee
retention and approaching the business like a community-centric restaurant that consumers
trust to feed their families. Annualized labor churn rates north of 100% have long plagued
convenience stores – it is hard to retain employees, let alone incentivize them to sell
perishables and run open air kitchens. Not so with Casey’s. Their stores have 40% more
staff than your typical gas station and they have used this as an opportunity to offer viable
career paths on a store-by-store basis throughout rural America. We have eaten our fair
share of Casey’s brisket pizza, and in our store tours we were impressed by the consistency
of quality and employee and customer loyalty that they have created at the store level. A
recent test roll-out of chicken wings has seen high satisfaction scores and we believe the
company is on its way to a system wide rollout of wings that has the potential to meaningfully
increase sales densities.
Casey’s stock has performed well over the last ten years and is up over 30% this year alone;
yet we believe the team from Des Moines is just getting started. The recent acquisition of
200 stores from Fike’s marked their entrance into the South, and management has since
commented that Texas alone could offer 2,000 more units (vs. today’s national footprint of
2,900), reinforcing our belief that there are plenty of towns across the South that would love
a Casey’s.

Our expectation is that this unit growth story is likely to play out more quickly than broadly
expected given Casey’s demonstrated ability to do accretive M&A. In the Fike’s example,
Casey’s paid 11x headline EBITDA, but the pro forma multiple looks more like 7x when pizza
is rolled out across the footprint. How many companies have the luxury of replicable,
accretive M&A at EBITDA multiples that are half of its own trading levels?
In Casey’s we see a world class management team with a differentiated mousetrap and a
decade of profitable growth ahead of them – whether they are labeled a restaurant or a gas
station or a general store is semantics. As the company’s slogan goes, “It’s Not Crazy, it’s
Casey’s!”
Informa PLC
During the quarter we made a new investment in Informa PLC, the global leader in B2B live
events. The company connects buyers and sellers in various industries, enabling business
interactions, and disseminating knowledge across verticals. We believe Informa has built a
strong, underappreciated moat around its core events business benefiting from network
effects, scale, and process power since managing events with tens of thousands of attendees
is not an easy endeavor. For example, some trade associations have reported incurring
losses on their annual shows, while Informa enjoys ~30% margins. Well-run scale events
build a brand and become “must-attend” franchises for industry participants.
Informa owns and runs some of the most recognizable events globally, including the
Monaco/Ft. Lauderdale Boat Shows, the Dubai Air Show, Cannes Lions, SuperReturn,
BlackHat, and Money 20/20. The business has strong visibility and positive working capital
dynamics. Often, next year’s iteration of an event will be more than half pre-sold by the end
of the current year’s show, giving the company elevated levels of predictability and relatively
low cyclicality.
Informa has also carved out what we see as a generational opportunity in the Middle East,
establishing JVs within both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Attracting business travel is a core
priority for both economies, and local governments are investing heavily in event venues
Page 5

that will support growth in B2B events for years to come. These JVs also allow Informa to
bring new iterations of its existing and successful brands into the Middle East, underscored
by Money 20/20 adding a Middle East show in Riyadh this fall. We expect more of Informa’s
marquee franchises to expand to the Middle East in short order.
One insight we have derived from our investment in Live Nation and have applied here is
that in a world that is becoming increasingly more digital, the value of high-quality live
events should meaningfully increase to both exhibitors and attendees. We believe the
company will accelerate revenue growth, particularly through its Middle East strategy, and
compound earnings at a double-digit rate for many years, all while returning meaningful
cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and acting as the sole
consolidator of the fragmented events industry. Despite these qualities, the stock trades at
a mere 14x forward earnings multiple.
Corporate Credit Update
Third Point corporate credit was up 2.9% gross (2.1% net) for the second quarter, bringing
2025 performance to 3.0% gross (1.8% net). Our year-to-date performance has lagged the
ICE BofA US high yield index primarily due to costs associated with hedges made to protect
capital during the quarter’s downturn as well as disappointing results from three credits
during Q1. We took the opportunity to add exposure to two of the three laggards.
Like equities, credit experienced extraordinary volatility during the quarter, with spreads

been able to identify opportunities to capitalize on brief credit dislocations in the past, this
was over in days and did not reach the levels or liquidity that make committing substantial
capital easy. We increased exposure on the back end of the spread spike as the tariff rhetoric
dialed down.
High yield bond spreads are plumbing the depths of the 2021 record lows, although yields
are still +300bps higher, providing some total return support. The real action in the market
continues to be in leveraged loans where spreads in CCC names remain close to 1000bps
Page 6

over B spreads. These wide spreads reflect the lower quality of the leverage loan universe –
defaults (including exchange offers) are running close to 5% – but are also a function of the
technical selling pressure created by CLOs. CLOs are highly leveraged structures that buy
diversified pools of leveraged loans and have limited baskets to own “CCC” credits. CLOs own
approximately 74% of the leveraged loan universe, up from 62% in 2020. Historically
leveraged loans were thought to be higher credit quality than high yield bonds since they are
typically senior and secured; however, today the reverse is true. That is partially a function
of CLO’s large, growing and arguably less discriminating buyer base. When you need to
accumulate positions in over one hundred credits in short order, it is inevitable that you do
not love every single one. Our team is devoting much of its time combing through this
universe and has been able to strengthen our research thanks to the number of leveraged
loans in the CLOs of the recently acquired Birch Grove business.
While longevity brings about aches and pains, it also aids in one of the most important skills
in investing: pattern recognition. In 2014, energy was the largest sector in the high yield
market at about 18% and “fracking” dramatically shifted the cost curve for oil and gas
production. Not only was credit’s energy sector eviscerated but the malaise spread across
the entire credit universe (exacerbated by a slowdown in China) and spreads blew out from
about 450bps to over 800bps. In 2016, as markets normalized, our corporate credit book

Today the largest sector of the leveraged loan universe is technology, at about 17%. While a
lot remains to be seen about the impact of AI technology on software providers, we believe
that, like fracking, AI represents a massive downward shift in the cost curve. In our view,
there will doubtless be beneficiaries in the space, but we suspect that it will be a challenging
transition for legacy software suppliers, especially highly leveraged ones with a limited
ability to reinvest. We are presently underweighting this sector but are spending a lot of time
here as there are already a number of stressed/distressed credits. If this unfolds as we think
it might, AI might do for credit in 2025/26 what fracking did in 2015/16.

Structured Credit Update
While most market cycles have shortened since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, we believe
the snapback after “Liberation Day” across equities and credit was impressively short. In
June, we saw the conclusion of an active quarter of trading with a Treasury rally of about
15bps on the 5-Year and investment grade credit spread tightening. As the equity market
traded to new highs, we saw three themes emerge.
1. The demand for residential mortgage credit remains strong. New US housing supply
remains low and with rates at these levels, we continue to see low housing turnover.
House price appreciation is trending towards 4% year-over-year and in our view, that
has created a resilient mortgage borrower that wants to hold onto their home given
the material amount of home equity. In particular, we have seen that there is a bid for
first lien, owner occupied residential mortgages as compared to second-lien loans at
75-80 LTV which are more susceptible to a price correction. As a result, we priced a
reperforming mortgage deal in June with the AAA tranche (representing
approximately 65% of market value) at a 5.5% yield with over fifteen different
investors. As rates potentially decline over the next few quarters, we see the potential
for a compelling total return on our mortgage positions as our discount dollar price
reperforming loans trade higher with more refinancings.
2. Hedge funds can find alpha in tradeable, liquid securities versus chasing private
credit. We have discussed our rental car ABS exposure in the previous letters. In June,
we added risk at around 550bps spread or 10% yield. Within three weeks, we saw
those spreads tighten to around 475bps, and we have been able to monetize some of
the position. Competition amongst large private credit firms has pushed execution
on larger blocks of loans to local tights, but, in our estimation our ability to capitalize
on dislocations provides compelling returns with increased liquidity.
3. Public companies with structured credit financing who are in distress can create
opportunities to source mid- to high-teens returns. In solar loan and lease financing,
we have seen multiple companies file for bankruptcy as persistently high rates
Page 8

overload their capital structures and business models. These companies originated
long duration solar loans at interest rates of 1.99-2.99% and relied on the
securitization market to finance these investments at comparably low rates. As rates
sold off, the profitability of these assets fell dramatically. The slew of bankruptcy
filings has challenged the assumptions of ABS investors, allowing us to source debt
tranches at steep discounts of $85 to $60 which to us have the capacity to deliver
returns in the mid- to high-teens.
While many investors see tightening credit spreads and the equity market at new highs, we
are excited by the emerging opportunity set in sectors like rental car ABS, solar ABS and
monetizing our reperforming mortgage trade in the coming quarters. Being nimble on
trading has enabled us to source sizeable opportunities that seek to generate capital
appreciation.
Sincerely,
Daniel S. Loeb

The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed
on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third
Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser
headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Master Fund LP in a master-feeder structure. Third
Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.
Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Master Fund LP inclusive of legacy private
investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable. Sector and geographic categories are
determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.
Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.
While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the
indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ
significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All information

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

The market continued to be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns of 43.4% and the S&P 500 to 26.2%. The Russell 2000 was up 16.9% and the Russell MicroCap index was up only 9.3% for 2023. Cedar Creek increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter, and was up 20.3% for 2023, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18 year history is 14.5%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses.

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of December 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.4 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 12.6 times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). The higher forward and trailing multiples as compared to prior quarters is largely due to the poor year by PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). More on that below. Weighted price to book, assuming no book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust, was 1.7. Dividend yield was 2.1%. Weighted expected return on equity as of December 31, 2023, was 21%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 7%. The increase was due to cash coming into the fund plus we exited Unit Corp (UNTC) and Harbor Diversified (HRBR). Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter, due to a decrease in the market price of Propel Media (PROM) which we profiled in our Q2 letter. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 39% exposure to the expert market and ended at 35% of the fund. Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 13.5% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 9% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 3.9% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link). Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings Propel Media (PROM) – was profiled in our Q2 letter and trades on the expert market. During the fourth quarter it declined in price from $1.10 per share to $0.89 per share. Our cost was $0.23 per share when we bought earlier in the year and we have received two dividends totaling $0.019 per share, or 8% of our basis. As you may recall we purchased shares due the potential acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) at a reported $700 to $800 million, or roughly $3 per share. The deal was held up at the FTC. We had no idea if the deal would go through or not but were very comfortable purchasing at 1/12 of the likely deal price. If the deal went through, we would make 12x. If the deal didn’t go through, we were comfortable that Plan B would still be meaningfully above what we were paying. Hearings took place in December. The judge unfortunately ruled in favor of the FTC. Propel and IQVIA decided not to appeal and terminated the deal. At $0.89 per share, the current market cap is approximately $225 million. We believe the dividends showed that Propel was profitable despite the litigation-related costs. We are very comfortable holding the investment at current prices. One benefit to the deal being blocked is that we would have incurred short-term capital gains had the deal closed, whereas now we are more likely to enjoy more favorable long-term capital gains. We think if Plan B was just a fraction of the deal’s value Propel would not have walked away. They would have thrown a hail mary and hoped for a win on appeal. So, we think it is very likely that Propel’s management believes that they can see value realization reasonably close to the IQVIA deal over time. Hopefully, having gotten a “taste” of value realization, management will be focused on unlocking value whether it be through a sale, merger, re-registration with the SEC, uplisting, etc. PharmChem (PCHM) became one of the larger positions in the fund due to a contribution in kind to the fund by the former Chairman of the Board of PharmChem. The transaction was announced August 31, 2023. I rejoined the Board and became Chairman. The fund previously owned about 3% of PharmChem. After the transaction, the fund is the largest shareholder, owning nearly 33% of the company. We look forward to working to unlock value for shareholders. Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 52% in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $10.00 per share to $15.25 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of Solitron. On September 1, 2023, Solitron closed its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc. (MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. 2022 revenue was approximately $5.9 million with operating income of $1.3 million, as compared to 2021 revenue of $5.5 million and operating income of $1.2 million. Subsequent to quarter end, Cedar Creek filed a Form 4 noting the fund purchased an additional 35,000 shares for $10.70 per share in a private transaction. Last week Solitron announced results for the fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2023. Revenue was $4.1 million, and bookings were $4.8 million. Solitron reported earnings of $86,000 or $0.04 per share. There were a number of one-time items including a $494,000 impact to cost of goods sold due to acquisition related accounting requiring inventory to be marked at fair value on the acquisition date, $200,000 of acquisition related expenses, $21,000 of intangible amortization and $26,000 of non-cash interest expense. Reported operating income was $218,000, while “adjusted operating income” would have been over $930,000, or roughly $0.45 per share. PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) – reported disappointing fiscal 2023 results late in December. We had expected results to be somewhat similar to fiscal 2022 results, but PD-Rx lost a key contract resulting in a 25% decline in revenues and earnings falling from $1.84 per share to a loss of $0.05 per share. It is frustrating that management wrote their fiscal 2022 letter halfway through the 2023 fiscal year and provided no hint that the business had changed. That is a poor way to treat shareholders. The share price has held up due to the strong balance sheet – book value of $6.84 per share and cash of $4.15 per share. Hopefully they can win back the business in the future and begin to treat shareholders with the respect they deserve as owners of the business. Either one would help the share price. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at the end of June 2022. During the fourth quarter the bid price increased from $36.90 to $37.70 per share. In a break from past practice, Citizens reported quarterly earnings publicly, instead of just filing a quarterly Call Report. Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 were $0.82 per share due to a $3 million write-down on a loan now held at the parent corporation. Absent the write-down earnings were excellent. We believe the current annualized earnings run rate is approximately $7 per share, resulting in a price to earnings ratio of under six, which is quite low for a bank with this level of potential. We believe the bank understands how to put the ECIP money to work to grow the bank while also returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Under ECIP, recipient banks are limited to returning no more than the current year’s income plus the prior two years’ income, less any returns of capital in the prior two years. In 2023 Citizens returned $5.5 million to shareholders by paying $1.5 million in dividends and repurchasing 5% of its shares for a cost of $4.0 million. Our estimate was Citizens started 2024 with the ability to use $16 million for capital return which would grow as they earn throughout the year. This is a significant amount in relation to Citizen’s yearend market cap of less than $72 million. We would love to see them repurchase all the stock they can at current prices. We would also expect a dividend this spring of $0.75 to $1.00 per share. We continue to think the stock is worth nearly twice its current price. Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.455 to $0.415 per unit in the fourth quarter. Things are progressing slowly in the battle between unitholders and the operator and Trustee. The operator tried to have a replacement trustee appointed that would liquidate. A judge rejected the trustee due to failing to meet the net worth qualifications as specified in the trust agreement. In a separate decision a judge rejected the operator’s petition to force liquidation, siding with the Trustee who argued it was in the best interests of unitholders for the audit to be completed first. It should be noted that no financials have been released since June 2019 and the Trustee has not stated publicly why there is a delay. We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t been able to complete them up until now. It appears this investment is going to continue to take some time to work out. United Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB) – is another ECIP recipient bank. The current price is $40.50 per share with 3.5 million shares outstanding, resulting in a market cap of just over $140 million. The bank received almost $124 million in ECIP funds. Trailing earnings are $7.31 per share. We expect fourth quarter earnings of $4 per share due to a $9 million capital magnet award (i.e. grant). For 2024 we are expecting $8 per share, meaning the bank is trading at 5 times forward earnings at 1.2 times yearend book value. Of course, book value grossly underestimates the value of the ECIP funds to common shareholders. Fair value of the preferred stock is 15-25% of its face value since the maximum dividend rate is 2%. If we assume fair value is 25% it results in an adjusted book value of $59 per share. UBAB is one of the few banks who has been able to meaningfully increase lending since receiving ECIP funds. Loans have increased from $686 million as of June 2022 to $808 million as of September 2023. So they may be able to have the preferred dividend lock in at a rate lower than 2%. Like Citizens, we think the fair value of UBAB is twice the current price. Saker Aviation (SKAS) – is a tiny company managing the heliport in downtown Manhattan. Total market cap is only $8.5 million based on just under one million shares outstanding and a current $8.50 share price. As of September 30, 2023 the company had $8.6 million in cash. Earnings in the September quarter were $1.20 per share. Unfortunately, that level of earnings is not likely to continue. During the September quarter the company did not have to pay any concession to the city of New York. Historically that amounted to 18-25% of revenues. Under the recently signed six-month operating agreement (with two possible six-month extensions) that started in mid-December, the new concession will be 30% of revenues. Had the 30% concession rate been in place in the September quarter operating income would have been 50% lower, but still very solid. Saker used to have a management contract with a former related party to manage the heliport. They terminated the agreement early in Q2 and, so far, have been able to manage the heliport themselves with little to no extra cost. Going forward, assuming they can manage the heliport internally and at least one six-month extension is exercised, we expect Saker to earn $1.70 per share in 2024, even after incurring the 30% concession fee to the city. If they can agree on a longer-term deal that does not require Saker to fund significant capital improvements, we think the stock can trade at a multiple to earnings versus currently trading at a liquidation value. In other words, we think we have meaningful potential upside with minimal downside, a scenario we like to have. It is the potential 50-100% upside from the current price which makes it worthwhile for the fund to have a 2% position in such a small stock. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all had a phenomenal fourth quarter. The market continued to be
led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns of
43.4% and the S&P 500 to 26.2%. The Russell 2000 was up 16.9% and the Russell MicroCap
index was up only 9.3% for 2023. Cedar Creek increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter, and
was up 20.3% for 2023, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18 year history is 14.5%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses.

as of December 31, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $279,578 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $647,868 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of December 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at
7.9 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.4 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 12.6
times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). The higher forward and
trailing multiples as compared to prior quarters is largely due to the poor year by PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). More on that below. Weighted price to book, assuming no book
value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust, was 1.7. Dividend yield was 2.1%. Weighted expected
return on equity as of December 31, 2023, was 21%.

We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 7%. The increase
was due to cash coming into the fund plus we exited Unit Corp (UNTC) and Harbor
Diversified (HRBR).

During the fourth quarter it declined in price from $1.10 per share to $0.89 per share. Our
cost was $0.23 per share when we bought earlier in the year and we have received two
dividends totaling $0.019 per share, or 8% of our basis. As you may recall we purchased
shares due the potential acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) at a reported $700 to $800
million, or roughly $3 per share. The deal was held up at the FTC. We had no idea if the
deal would go through or not but were very comfortable purchasing at 1/12 of the likely deal
price. If the deal went through, we would make 12x. If the deal didn’t go through, we were
comfortable that Plan B would still be meaningfully above what we were paying. Hearings
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. At
yearend, we used a projection of $0.08 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust. If courts rule against claims
of unitholders and actual earnings are zero, then the fund’s holdings are trading at 8.4 times our estimates of
earnings for the coming year, and 6.8 times net of cash at the respective businesses. Our use of $0 for book value
for Pacific Coast Oil Trust is not meant to convey that is what we think true book value is. The trust is over four
years late in filings. The last filing, which was for June 20, 2109, showed the trust having net assets of $199
million, or $5.16 per unit, but that is prior to the ARO assessment.

took place in December. The judge unfortunately ruled in favor of the FTC. Propel and IQVIA
decided not to appeal and terminated the deal. At $0.89 per share, the current market cap
is approximately $225 million.
We believe the dividends showed that Propel was profitable despite the litigation-related
costs. We are very comfortable holding the investment at current prices. One benefit to the
deal being blocked is that we would have incurred short-term capital gains had the deal
closed, whereas now we are more likely to enjoy more favorable long-term capital gains. We
think if Plan B was just a fraction of the deal’s value Propel would not have walked away.
They would have thrown a hail mary and hoped for a win on appeal. So, we think it is very
likely that Propel’s management believes that they can see value realization reasonably close
to the IQVIA deal over time. Hopefully, having gotten a “taste” of value realization,
management will be focused on unlocking value whether it be through a sale, merger, re-
registration with the SEC, uplisting, etc.
PharmChem (PCHM) became one of the larger positions in the fund due to a contribution in
kind to the fund by the former Chairman of the Board of PharmChem. The transaction was
announced August 31, 2023. I rejoined the Board and became Chairman. The fund
previously owned about 3% of PharmChem. After the transaction, the fund is the largest
shareholder, owning nearly 33% of the company. We look forward to working to unlock value
for shareholders.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 52% in the fourth quarter
of 2023 from $10.00 per share to $15.25 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. On September 1, 2023, Solitron closed its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc.
(MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. 2022 revenue
was approximately $5.9 million with operating income of $1.3 million, as compared to 2021
revenue of $5.5 million and operating income of $1.2 million. Subsequent to quarter end,
Cedar Creek filed a Form 4 noting the fund purchased an additional 35,000 shares for $10.70
per share in a private transaction. Last week Solitron announced results for the fiscal third
quarter ending November 30, 2023. Revenue was $4.1 million, and bookings were $4.8
million. Solitron reported earnings of $86,000 or $0.04 per share. There were a number of
one-time items including a $494,000 impact to cost of goods sold due to acquisition related
accounting requiring inventory to be marked at fair value on the acquisition date, $200,000
of acquisition related expenses, $21,000 of intangible amortization and $26,000 of non-cash
interest expense. Reported operating income was $218,000, while “adjusted operating
income” would have been over $930,000, or roughly $0.45 per share.
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) – reported disappointing fiscal 2023 results late in
December. We had expected results to be somewhat similar to fiscal 2022 results, but PD-
Rx lost a key contract resulting in a 25% decline in revenues and earnings falling from $1.84
per share to a loss of $0.05 per share. It is frustrating that management wrote their fiscal
2022 letter halfway through the 2023 fiscal year and provided no hint that the business had
changed. That is a poor way to treat shareholders. The share price has held up due to the
strong balance sheet – book value of $6.84 per share and cash of $4.15 per share. Hopefully
they can win back the business in the future and begin to treat shareholders with the respect
they deserve as owners of the business. Either one would help the share price.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. During the fourth quarter the bid price increased from $36.90 to
$37.70 per share. In a break from past practice, Citizens reported quarterly earnings
publicly, instead of just filing a quarterly Call Report. Earnings for the third quarter of 2023
were $0.82 per share due to a $3 million write-down on a loan now held at the parent
corporation. Absent the write-down earnings were excellent. We believe the current

annualized earnings run rate is approximately $7 per share, resulting in a price to earnings
ratio of under six, which is quite low for a bank with this level of potential.
We believe the bank understands how to put the ECIP money to work to grow the bank while
also returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Under ECIP,
recipient banks are limited to returning no more than the current year’s income plus the prior
two years’ income, less any returns of capital in the prior two years. In 2023 Citizens returned
$5.5 million to shareholders by paying $1.5 million in dividends and repurchasing 5% of its
shares for a cost of $4.0 million. Our estimate was Citizens started 2024 with the ability to
use $16 million for capital return which would grow as they earn throughout the year. This
is a significant amount in relation to Citizen’s yearend market cap of less than $72 million.
We would love to see them repurchase all the stock they can at current prices. We would
also expect a dividend this spring of $0.75 to $1.00 per share. We continue to think the
stock is worth nearly twice its current price.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.455 to $0.415 per unit in the
fourth quarter. Things are progressing slowly in the battle between unitholders and the
operator and Trustee. The operator tried to have a replacement trustee appointed that would
liquidate. A judge rejected the trustee due to failing to meet the net worth qualifications as
specified in the trust agreement. In a separate decision a judge rejected the operator’s
petition to force liquidation, siding with the Trustee who argued it was in the best interests
of unitholders for the audit to be completed first. It should be noted that no financials have
been released since June 2019 and the Trustee has not stated publicly why there is a delay.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them up until now. It appears this investment is going to continue to
take some time to work out.
United Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB) – is another ECIP recipient bank. The current
price is $40.50 per share with 3.5 million shares outstanding, resulting in a market cap of
just over $140 million. The bank received almost $124 million in ECIP funds. Trailing
earnings are $7.31 per share. We expect fourth quarter earnings of $4 per share due to a
$9 million capital magnet award (i.e. grant). For 2024 we are expecting $8 per share,
meaning the bank is trading at 5 times forward earnings at 1.2 times yearend book value.
Of course, book value grossly underestimates the value of the ECIP funds to common
shareholders. Fair value of the preferred stock is 15-25% of its face value since the maximum
dividend rate is 2%. If we assume fair value is 25% it results in an adjusted book value of
$59 per share. UBAB is one of the few banks who has been able to meaningfully increase
lending since receiving ECIP funds. Loans have increased from $686 million as of June 2022
to $808 million as of September 2023. So they may be able to have the preferred dividend
lock in at a rate lower than 2%. Like Citizens, we think the fair value of UBAB is twice the
current price.
Saker Aviation (SKAS) – is a tiny company managing the heliport in downtown Manhattan.
Total market cap is only $8.5 million based on just under one million shares outstanding and
a current $8.50 share price. As of September 30, 2023 the company had $8.6 million in
cash. Earnings in the September quarter were $1.20 per share. Unfortunately, that level of
earnings is not likely to continue. During the September quarter the company did not have
to pay any concession to the city of New York. Historically that amounted to 18-25% of
revenues. Under the recently signed six-month operating agreement (with two possible six-
month extensions) that started in mid-December, the new concession will be 30% of
revenues. Had the 30% concession rate been in place in the September quarter operating
income would have been 50% lower, but still very solid. Saker used to have a management
contract with a former related party to manage the heliport. They terminated the agreement
early in Q2 and, so far, have been able to manage the heliport themselves with little to no
extra cost.

Going forward, assuming they can manage the heliport internally and at least one six-month
extension is exercised, we expect Saker to earn $1.70 per share in 2024, even after incurring
the 30% concession fee to the city. If they can agree on a longer-term deal that does not
require Saker to fund significant capital improvements, we think the stock can trade at a
multiple to earnings versus currently trading at a liquidation value. In other words, we think
we have meaningful potential upside with minimal downside, a scenario we like to have. It
is the potential 50-100% upside from the current price which makes it worthwhile for the
fund to have a 2% position in such a small stock.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

The market continued to be led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns of 43.4% and the S&P 500 to 26.2%. The Russell 2000 was up 16.9% and the Russell MicroCap index was up only 9.3% for 2023. Cedar Creek increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter, and was up 20.3% for 2023, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18 year history is 14.5%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses. Q4 ‘23 2023 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 2.8% 20.3% 1,040.0% 14.5% NASDAQ 13.6% 43.4% 547.9% 11.0% S&P 500 (SPY) 11.6% 26.2% 422.5% 9.6% DJIA (DIA) 13.1% 16.2% 418.9% 9.6% Russell 2000 14.0% 16.9% 265.3% 7.5% Russell Microcap 16.1% 9.3% 179.6% 5.9% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,140,049 as of December 31, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices we compare against would have only grown to between $279,578 in the Russell Micro Cap and $647,868 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of December 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at 7.9 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.4 times expected earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Trailing earnings multiple was 12.6 times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). The higher forward and trailing multiples as compared to prior quarters is largely due to the poor year by PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). More on that below. Weighted price to book, assuming no book value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust, was 1.7. Dividend yield was 2.1%. Weighted expected return on equity as of December 31, 2023, was 21%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 7%. The increase was due to cash coming into the fund plus we exited Unit Corp (UNTC) and Harbor Diversified (HRBR). Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter, due to a decrease in the market price of Propel Media (PROM) which we profiled in our Q2 letter. Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 39% exposure to the expert market and ended at 35% of the fund. Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM) is about 13.5% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 9% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 3.9% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter. We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link). Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings Propel Media (PROM) – was profiled in our Q2 letter and trades on the expert market.

Trailing earnings are $7.31 per share. We expect fourth quarter earnings of $4 per share due to a $9 million capital magnet award (i.e. grant).

In other words, we think we have meaningful potential upside with minimal downside, a scenario we like to have. It is the potential 50-100% upside from the current price which makes it worthwhile for the fund to have a 2% position in such a small stock. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2023 Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
The major indices we track all had a phenomenal fourth quarter. The market continued to be
led by a small handful of tech companies propelling the NASDAQ to year-to-date returns of
43.4% and the S&P 500 to 26.2%. The Russell 2000 was up 16.9% and the Russell MicroCap
index was up only 9.3% for 2023. Cedar Creek increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter, and
was up 20.3% for 2023, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 18 year history is 14.5%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 1,006.6%, net of fees and expenses.
Q4 ‘23 2023 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 2.8% 20.3% 1,040.0% 14.5%
NASDAQ 13.6% 43.4% 547.9% 11.0%
S&P 500 (SPY) 11.6% 26.2% 422.5% 9.6%
DJIA (DIA) 13.1% 16.2% 418.9% 9.6%
Russell 2000 14.0% 16.9% 265.3% 7.5%
Russell Microcap 16.1% 9.3% 179.6% 5.9%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $1,140,049
as of December 31, 2023, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indices
we compare against would have only grown to between $279,578 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $647,868 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can
generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an
index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo!
Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of December 2023, the fund’s holdings were trading at
7.9 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 6.4 times expected
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Trailing earnings multiple was 12.6
times assuming no earnings for Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL). The higher forward and
trailing multiples as compared to prior quarters is largely due to the poor year by PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). More on that below. Weighted price to book, assuming no book
value for Pacific Coast Oil Trust, was 1.7. Dividend yield was 2.1%. Weighted expected
return on equity as of December 31, 2023, was 21%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 7%. The increase
was due to cash coming into the fund plus we exited Unit Corp (UNTC) and Harbor
Diversified (HRBR).
Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to stocks trading in the expert market decreased in the quarter, due to a
decrease in the market price of Propel Media (PROM) which we profiled in our Q2 letter.
Expert market stocks are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar,
the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but
also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker,
are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 39% exposure to the
expert market and ended at 35% of the fund.
Three positions make up about 75% of the expert market exposure – Propel Media (PROM)
is about 13.5% of the fund, PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) is about 9% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is roughly 3.9% of the fund. We discussed PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our Q2 2022 letter.
We also provided more detail on both in our 2022 yearend letter (link).
Update on a Few of Our Top Holdings
Propel Media (PROM) – was profiled in our Q2 letter and trades on the expert market.
During the fourth quarter it declined in price from $1.10 per share to $0.89 per share. Our
cost was $0.23 per share when we bought earlier in the year and we have received two
dividends totaling $0.019 per share, or 8% of our basis. As you may recall we purchased
shares due the potential acquisition of Propel by IQVIA (IQV) at a reported $700 to $800
million, or roughly $3 per share. The deal was held up at the FTC. We had no idea if the
deal would go through or not but were very comfortable purchasing at 1/12 of the likely deal
price. If the deal went through, we would make 12x. If the deal didn’t go through, we were
comfortable that Plan B would still be meaningfully above what we were paying. Hearings
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. At
yearend, we used a projection of $0.08 in earnings per unit for Pacific Coast Oil Trust. If courts rule against claims
of unitholders and actual earnings are zero, then the fund’s holdings are trading at 8.4 times our estimates of
earnings for the coming year, and 6.8 times net of cash at the respective businesses. Our use of $0 for book value
for Pacific Coast Oil Trust is not meant to convey that is what we think true book value is. The trust is over four
years late in filings. The last filing, which was for June 20, 2109, showed the trust having net assets of $199
million, or $5.16 per unit, but that is prior to the ARO assessment.

took place in December. The judge unfortunately ruled in favor of the FTC. Propel and IQVIA
decided not to appeal and terminated the deal. At $0.89 per share, the current market cap
is approximately $225 million.
We believe the dividends showed that Propel was profitable despite the litigation-related
costs. We are very comfortable holding the investment at current prices. One benefit to the
deal being blocked is that we would have incurred short-term capital gains had the deal
closed, whereas now we are more likely to enjoy more favorable long-term capital gains. We
think if Plan B was just a fraction of the deal’s value Propel would not have walked away.
They would have thrown a hail mary and hoped for a win on appeal. So, we think it is very
likely that Propel’s management believes that they can see value realization reasonably close
to the IQVIA deal over time. Hopefully, having gotten a “taste” of value realization,
management will be focused on unlocking value whether it be through a sale, merger, re-
registration with the SEC, uplisting, etc.
PharmChem (PCHM) became one of the larger positions in the fund due to a contribution in
kind to the fund by the former Chairman of the Board of PharmChem. The transaction was
announced August 31, 2023. I rejoined the Board and became Chairman. The fund
previously owned about 3% of PharmChem. After the transaction, the fund is the largest
shareholder, owning nearly 33% of the company. We look forward to working to unlock value
for shareholders.
Solitron Devices (SODI) - the bid price for shares increased by 52% in the fourth quarter
of 2023 from $10.00 per share to $15.25 per share. As a reminder, I am CEO and CFO of
Solitron. On September 1, 2023, Solitron closed its acquisition of Micro Engineering Inc.
(MEI). MEI produces electronic components primarily for the medical industry. 2022 revenue
was approximately $5.9 million with operating income of $1.3 million, as compared to 2021
revenue of $5.5 million and operating income of $1.2 million. Subsequent to quarter end,
Cedar Creek filed a Form 4 noting the fund purchased an additional 35,000 shares for $10.70
per share in a private transaction. Last week Solitron announced results for the fiscal third
quarter ending November 30, 2023. Revenue was $4.1 million, and bookings were $4.8
million. Solitron reported earnings of $86,000 or $0.04 per share. There were a number of
one-time items including a $494,000 impact to cost of goods sold due to acquisition related
accounting requiring inventory to be marked at fair value on the acquisition date, $200,000
of acquisition related expenses, $21,000 of intangible amortization and $26,000 of non-cash
interest expense. Reported operating income was $218,000, while “adjusted operating
income” would have been over $930,000, or roughly $0.45 per share.
PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) – reported disappointing fiscal 2023 results late in
December. We had expected results to be somewhat similar to fiscal 2022 results, but PD-
Rx lost a key contract resulting in a 25% decline in revenues and earnings falling from $1.84
per share to a loss of $0.05 per share. It is frustrating that management wrote their fiscal
2022 letter halfway through the 2023 fiscal year and provided no hint that the business had
changed. That is a poor way to treat shareholders. The share price has held up due to the
strong balance sheet – book value of $6.84 per share and cash of $4.15 per share. Hopefully
they can win back the business in the future and begin to treat shareholders with the respect
they deserve as owners of the business. Either one would help the share price.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) - is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank that received $95.7 million
of additional capital via the US Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) at
the end of June 2022. During the fourth quarter the bid price increased from $36.90 to
$37.70 per share. In a break from past practice, Citizens reported quarterly earnings
publicly, instead of just filing a quarterly Call Report. Earnings for the third quarter of 2023
were $0.82 per share due to a $3 million write-down on a loan now held at the parent
corporation. Absent the write-down earnings were excellent. We believe the current

annualized earnings run rate is approximately $7 per share, resulting in a price to earnings
ratio of under six, which is quite low for a bank with this level of potential.
We believe the bank understands how to put the ECIP money to work to grow the bank while
also returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Under ECIP,
recipient banks are limited to returning no more than the current year’s income plus the prior
two years’ income, less any returns of capital in the prior two years. In 2023 Citizens returned
$5.5 million to shareholders by paying $1.5 million in dividends and repurchasing 5% of its
shares for a cost of $4.0 million. Our estimate was Citizens started 2024 with the ability to
use $16 million for capital return which would grow as they earn throughout the year. This
is a significant amount in relation to Citizen’s yearend market cap of less than $72 million.
We would love to see them repurchase all the stock they can at current prices. We would
also expect a dividend this spring of $0.75 to $1.00 per share. We continue to think the
stock is worth nearly twice its current price.
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) units decreased from $0.455 to $0.415 per unit in the
fourth quarter. Things are progressing slowly in the battle between unitholders and the
operator and Trustee. The operator tried to have a replacement trustee appointed that would
liquidate. A judge rejected the trustee due to failing to meet the net worth qualifications as
specified in the trust agreement. In a separate decision a judge rejected the operator’s
petition to force liquidation, siding with the Trustee who argued it was in the best interests
of unitholders for the audit to be completed first. It should be noted that no financials have
been released since June 2019 and the Trustee has not stated publicly why there is a delay.
We don’t see how the audits will magically be completed in the coming months if they haven’t
been able to complete them up until now. It appears this investment is going to continue to
take some time to work out.
United Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB) – is another ECIP recipient bank. The current
price is $40.50 per share with 3.5 million shares outstanding, resulting in a market cap of
just over $140 million. The bank received almost $124 million in ECIP funds. Trailing
earnings are $7.31 per share. We expect fourth quarter earnings of $4 per share due to a
$9 million capital magnet award (i.e. grant). For 2024 we are expecting $8 per share,
meaning the bank is trading at 5 times forward earnings at 1.2 times yearend book value.
Of course, book value grossly underestimates the value of the ECIP funds to common
shareholders. Fair value of the preferred stock is 15-25% of its face value since the maximum
dividend rate is 2%. If we assume fair value is 25% it results in an adjusted book value of
$59 per share. UBAB is one of the few banks who has been able to meaningfully increase
lending since receiving ECIP funds. Loans have increased from $686 million as of June 2022
to $808 million as of September 2023. So they may be able to have the preferred dividend
lock in at a rate lower than 2%. Like Citizens, we think the fair value of UBAB is twice the
current price.
Saker Aviation (SKAS) – is a tiny company managing the heliport in downtown Manhattan.
Total market cap is only $8.5 million based on just under one million shares outstanding and
a current $8.50 share price. As of September 30, 2023 the company had $8.6 million in
cash. Earnings in the September quarter were $1.20 per share. Unfortunately, that level of
earnings is not likely to continue. During the September quarter the company did not have
to pay any concession to the city of New York. Historically that amounted to 18-25% of
revenues. Under the recently signed six-month operating agreement (with two possible six-
month extensions) that started in mid-December, the new concession will be 30% of
revenues. Had the 30% concession rate been in place in the September quarter operating
income would have been 50% lower, but still very solid. Saker used to have a management
contract with a former related party to manage the heliport. They terminated the agreement
early in Q2 and, so far, have been able to manage the heliport themselves with little to no
extra cost.

Going forward, assuming they can manage the heliport internally and at least one six-month
extension is exercised, we expect Saker to earn $1.70 per share in 2024, even after incurring
the 30% concession fee to the city. If they can agree on a longer-term deal that does not
require Saker to fund significant capital improvements, we think the stock can trade at a
multiple to earnings versus currently trading at a liquidation value. In other words, we think
we have meaningful potential upside with minimal downside, a scenario we like to have. It
is the potential 50-100% upside from the current price which makes it worthwhile for the
fund to have a 2% position in such a small stock.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring
friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that
each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net
worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2023 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.
Forward Looking Statements
This letter and the accompanying discussion include forward-looking statements. All statements that are
not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including any statements that relate to future market
conditions, results, operations, strategies or other future conditions or developments and any statements
regarding objectives, opportunities, positioning or prospects. Forward-looking statements are

"Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd.",,"March 31, 2023",2023.0,1.0,-4.2,S&P 500,7.5,-11.7,"Net MTD, QTD and YTD performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%) class of each Fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable). Net performance reflects the deduction of operating expenses paid by the Fund during the period. An individual investor’s performance may vary based on timing of capital transactions.

Certain of Third Point Ultra Onshore LP's expenses are subject to a cap of 15 bps of the fund’s AUM for the first five years since inception. During this period, the Investment Manager (and not the fund) has paid the applicable expenses exceeding this cap. If such expenses were borne by the fund, its MTD/ITD returns would have been lower. Please see the fund's offering memorandum for a description of expenses borne by the fund within the first five years since inception.

Includes capital managed for SiriusPoint Ltd. in Third Point Enhanced LP and a managed account, as well as capital managed by Third Point Private CRE Credit LLC.

The sum of long and short exposure percentages and the sum of gross long and short MTD and YTD P&L percentages may not visually add to the corresponding net figure due to rounding. Subtotals of long, short, and/or net exposure percentages and MTD and YTD P&L percentages may not visually match the corresponding subtotal in another section of the report due to rounding.

Gross P&L attribution does not reflect the deduction of management fees, incentive allocations and any non-trading expenses which may be incurred in the management of the fund. An investor’s actual return will be reduced by such fees and expenses. See Part 2A of the Adviser's Form ADV for a description of the management fees and incentive allocations customarily charged by Adviser.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced investment or sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L attribution reflects the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L, or referenced individual position level gross P&L, as applicable. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group, or referenced individual position, as applicable. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from the Fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group, or referenced individual position, as applicable, with i) positive P&L and, ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group or referenced individual investment, as applicable, given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on an investment or sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on an investment or sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

Includes constructivism, activism and post-activism positions. “Constructivism” is defined as communications with an issuer regarding Third Point ideas to increase shareholder value that conclude without activism. “Activism” is defined as an active campaign currently ongoing.

Includes broad-based market and equity-based hedges.

Includes currency hedges, digital assets, and macro investments. Interest rate swaptions, rates and FX related investments are excluded from exposure figures. MTD and YTD P&L of Other includes net attribution of macro investments, digital assets, as well as residual gains and losses attributable to unhedged currency movements relative to USD, and interest, income and expense on cash balances.

Excludes any confidential positions, portfolio level equity hedges and EU MAR related positions.

Does not include private debt.

Market capitalization reflects only those holdings that are exchange-listed equity or any synthetic equity with an underlying reference instrument market capitalization.

Beta-adjusted exposures are calculated relative to the S&P based on one-year of historical daily returns for USD denominated assets and weekly returns for foreign denominated assets. Dollar-adjusted exposures are calculated with option positions shown at current market value in lieu of delta-adjusted exposure.

Equity positions do not include SPAC holdings and related transactions that have not yet announced a business combination agreement.

Includes broad-based market hedges and interest rate/spread hedges. Interest rate/spread hedges are excluded from exposure figures.

Includes broad-based market hedges.

Implied Duration represents the modified duration given the DV01 and notional exposure of underlying positions.

Other includes non-tranched ABS, CDS, and direct asset investments.

From Fund inception through December 31, 2019, each Fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees, incentive allocations, and expenses paid by the Fund. The actual management fees and incentive allocations paid by the Fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and incentive allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or incentive allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 3% (in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable) per annum. The amount of incentive allocations applicable to any one investor in the Fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for the Fund from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. During this period, had the highest management fee and incentive allocation been applied solely, performance results would likely be lower. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, each Fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%) class of the Fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. Net performance reflects the deduction of operating expenses paid by the Fund during the period. An individual investor’s performance may vary based on timing of capital transactions. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd. is December 1, 1996, Third Point Partners L.P. is June 1, 1995, Third Point Partners Qualified L.P. is January 1, 2005, Third Point Ultra Ltd. is May 1, 1997, and Third Point Ultra Onshore LP is January 2019.

All references to the S&P 500 and the MSCI World Index reflect performance calculated from the applicable Fund's inception date through March 31, 2023.

ASC levels provided are as of December 31, 2022.

Proforma Opt-Out ASC Levels show the percentage breakdown of the total absolute value of all levelled investments held by the fund as of December 31, 2022 excluding the absolute value of private investments held only by side pocket classes.

Net MTD and YTD track record for Opt-In investor shows indicative performance for a new issue eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and incentive allocation rate (20%) class of Third Point Partners L.P. who has participated in all side pocket private investments from March 1, 2021 onward. Net MTD and YTD track record for Opt-Out investor shows indicative performance for a new issue eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and incentive allocation rate (20%) class for Third Point Partners L.P. who has not participated in any side pocket private investments. Net performance reflects the deduction of operating expenses paid by the Fund during the period. The market price for new issues is often subject to significant fluctuation, and investors who are eligible to participate in new issues may experience significant gains or losses.

All fund level net profit and loss or performance results are based on the net asset value of fee paying investors only and are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, any other expenses of the Funds, and accrued incentive allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While incentive allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances annually or upon withdrawal. The Funds’ performance information shown within includes net gains and losses from “new issues.” The market price for new issues is often subject to significant fluctuation, and investors who are eligible to participate in new issues may experience significant gains or losses.

Letter to Limited Partners Third Quarter 2023

The cover image shows a map of existing and planned nuclear power reactors
in the US in March, 1973. On the date of this map’s publication, the future mix
of power certainly appeared to include a substantial contribution from nuclear
reactors. However, construction costs and operating reliability issues combined
with changing public attitudes towards nuclear power would see over half of
the planned capacity abandoned or shuttered in the coming decades.
One of the planned plants shown on this map that was ultimately constructed
was the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station. This plant, its reactor is
diagrammed above, is owned by Alluvial Fund holding Talen Energy. Read the
letter to learn more about Talen.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund fell 1.1% in the third quarter. This compares favorably to our benchmarks. The small-
cap Russell 2000 Index produced a total return of -5.2% in the quarter, while the Russell Micro-Cap
Index returned a lamentable -7.9%. Year-to-date, Alluvial fund is up 11.6%, strongly outpacing
comparable indexes. Consistent with the historical pattern, the fund outperformed in this quarter’s
dreary environment thanks to a focus on little-known securities with strong balance sheets and
predictable cash flows. Multiple portfolio holdings reported positive business developments and
healthy earnings, which buoyed shares.

The Backdrop
Much ink has been spilled on the topic of the dismal recent performance of small-cap and micro-
cap stocks. Probably a few tears as well. As I write, the Russell 2000 has given up all its year-to-date
gains and then some. The Russell Micro-Cap Index is dreadful, down 12% in 2023. But wait, it gets
worse! The Russell 2000 is 25% lower than its June 2021 peak and the Russell Micro-Cap Index is
off 40%. Investing in small companies has been nothing short of a slog of late. But while the bear
market may be painful, it is also healthy. From time to time, excesses must be flushed out of the
system. The zero-interest rate era saw numerous companies brought to market with the flimsiest
of business models and dubious chances of generating profits. A big part of this downturn is the
share prices of these dodgy enterprises converging with their intrinsic values. Investors overpaid
for low quality assets and now reality is setting in.
Interest rates are the driving force behind this re-evaluation. Investors may have been happy to
roll the dice on a risky small cap when the opportunity cost was nil. Now that cash earns a safe
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

5%, the casino does not have the same draw. Again, I think this is ultimately a good and healthy
development, but the adjustment is painful. The funding environment is radically different than
it was a year ago. I expect more pain for shareholders of companies that must access meaningful
external capital. The repricing of maturing debt capital will be a headwind for the foreseeable
future.
Fortunately, our portfolio is heavily weighted TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 9/30/23 (%)

Departing Investments
The fund invested in preferred shares of the Swedish investment company Navigo Invest AB (then
called Pegroco Invest AB) in early 2021. The onset of the COVID crisis led the company to suspend
dividend payments, causing its preferred shares to trade down to well below par. We invested
as signs of an economic recovery were growing, paying around SEK 70 per share. Over the next
two years, the shares recovered and resumed paying dividends. Navigo merged with another
investment company and prepared to list its common shares in Stockholm. With the company back
in good financial health and limited remaining upside, it was time to sell and move on. We exited
our position in Navigo Invest preferreds at around SEK 120, realizing a 30% IRR.
Late in the quarter, we sold our entire position in Wheeler REIT Series L convertible notes. Our
multi-year involvement with the various Wheeler REIT securities was more misadventure than
anything, but we were able to salvage a gain thanks to these notes. At issuance, the Wheeler REIT
notes were potentially convertible into common units at a steep discount to market value, making
the notes immediately worth a large premium to par value. We accumulated a good-sized position,
paying around $30 per note, and have now disposed of them at prices in the low $50s. Over the
last couple of years, I became one of the better-informed market participants on Wheeler REIT, but
I still do not understand this company’s decision-making or ultimate goals. I am more than happy
to wash my hands of the entire situation and find easier and less aggravating ways to earn a good
return on our collective capital.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

New Holdings
I have a soft spot for family-run businesses in boring industries far from global financial centers.
Shocker, right? Problem is, many of these businesses are run for insiders, with the idea that
outside investors should be happy with whatever scraps they receive after the “real owners”
are satisfied. Monarch Cement Company is a happy exception. Founded in 1908 in Humboldt,
Kansas, by H.F.G. Wulf, Monarch Cement operates a cement plant with >1 million tons of annual
capacity. Walter H. Wulf, Jr., grandson of the founder, is CEO and chairman. Monarch produces
and distributes Portland Cement and ready-mix concrete across Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa. The
company has a stellar track record of profitability and growth.
Cement is nothing new for Alluvial Fund. We have been happily invested in a similar company,
Boston Sand & Gravel, for several years. In Monarch Cement, I see an opportunity to own another
rare asset with a huge economic moat, at a very attractive price.
Monarch is having a record year thanks to high cement prices and strong demand from
construction and infrastructure projects. Despite strong performance year-to-date, Monarch
Cement shares trade at just 5.5x my estimate of 2023 EBITDA and <10x net income. Monarch
employs no debt and holds a substantial cash and securities portfolio. The company pays a healthy
dividend and regularly repurchases shares. While the cement business is cyclical and Monarch will
have its ups and downs, the current price represents an attractive entry point.
I don’t put a lot of trust in relative valuations, but it’s worth mentioning that Monarch Cement
trades at a 40% discount to most other public cement producers. If the company were sold,
shareholders could expect a very healthy premium. I don’t expect the Wulf family to sell any
time soon. Then again, family-controlled
businesses tend to be “Not for sale!” until
TABLE III: World Allocation, 9/30/23 (%)
the minute they are. Whatever happens, I

will continue creating and sharing wealth for

decades to come.
Poland 5.9
We invested in a new post-bankruptcy
United Kingdom 1.6
security in the quarter, Talen Energy Corp.
Talen owns a variety of power generation Denmark 1.4
assets. Its crown jewel is the Susquehanna
Other 0.7
Steam Electric Station, a two-unit nuclear
power plant with 2.5 gigawatts of capacity, Total 100%
enough to power 2 million homes. Talen
sought bankruptcy protection after struggling with excess debt and high hedging costs. The
company emerged from bankruptcy in May, shedding billions in debt. Talen shares currently trade
over-the-counter, but I expect the company to achieve an exchange listing in short order.
Talen has numerous tailwinds that support a much higher share price. The Inflation Reduction
Act passed last year contains supports and subsidies for nuclear power production, essentially
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

providing Talen with a price floor and reducing its hedging costs. The result is a de-risked business
model and a higher justified multiple of earnings and cash flows. Talen’s nuclear plants could be
desirable assets for larger regulated utilities looking to expand their renewables fleets. Acquisition
rumors have swirled, but nothing has materialized yet. In the absence of a transaction, I would not
be surprised to see Talen separate its nuclear assets from its legacy “dirty” natural gas and coal
generation assets. Finally, Talen has a 95% stake in a new data center being built adjacent to the
Susquehanna plant. There is strong interest in data centers powered by renewable energy sources,
and Talen expects to sell the data center or otherwise monetize the asset. I expect Talen will look
much different by this time a year from now, if it is still independent at all.
Next is Hammond Manufacturing Corp. We also own shares of Hammond Power Solutions, but
this is the other Canadian industrial company, run by the other Hammond brother. I hope that
clears things up. Hammond Manufacturing is significantly smaller than Hammond Power Solutions,
but it is consistently profitable, and its products are experiencing a huge growth in demand.
Hammond Manufacturing produces enclosures, cabinets, and racks for electrical applications. It
also produces power distribution products like power strips and small transformers. All products
that have seen great growth in demand thanks to the boom in data center construction, industrial
facilities investment, and electrification.
The strong US Dollar benefits Hammond Manufacturing. About 60% of Hammond’s sales are to
US customers, while its expenses are all in Canadian Dollars. At the current run rate, Hammond
Manufacturing shares trade at less than 5 times earnings. Free cash flow has been low of late as
the company rebuilt depleted inventories and finished construction on a new facility in Palmerston,
Ontario. Now that these investments are complete, I expect the company will focus on reducing
debt and rewarding shareholders.
Finally, we have built a position in Seneca Foods. Seneca is a supplier of possibly the least
glamorous product around: canned vegetables. I actually prefer the taste of certain canned
veggies over fresh or frozen, but that seems to be an unpopular opinion. Still, there is a large
market for canned vegetables, which appeal to the budget-conscious consumer. The market values
Seneca like a relic in irreversible decline. That’s why shares trade at half of tangible book value
and below net current asset value. I happen to think Seneca is in substantially better shape than
the market believes, thanks to changes in the market structure of the canned vegetables industry.
Simply put, there is only so much profit to go around in a mature market. Seneca earned a good
share of those profits until Del Monte, in a bid for market share, cut prices and bought a small,
struggling producer. This went poorly for Del Monte, which ultimately chose to exit the market,
shutting down some packing plants and selling others, including to Seneca Foods. Since Del
Monte exited, Seneca’s profits have bounced back. With Del Monte humbled and nobody else
eager to rush in, I expect Seneca to enjoy a lengthy period of healthy profits and stable market
share.
Seneca Foods shares trade at a mid-single digit multiple of 2023 profits. The company’s capital
allocation is reasonably good, with shares outstanding down 22% over the last 5 years and no
major investment missteps. The company’s accounting earnings can be volatile thanks to a quirk
of inventory accounting. Seneca Foods is one of the few remaining public companies to employ
*Image from Logistec’s 2022 Financial Report
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

“LIFO” (last in, first out) inventory valuation, which has the practical effect of understanding the
value of its inventory by $300 million. The LIFO convention results in under-stated earnings in
periods of rising input costs and over-stated earnings when input costs are falling. Nobody should
mistake Seneca Foods for a growth company or a return on capital standout, but neither should
shares languish at 5x earnings.
Portfolio Updates
FitLife Brands continues to impress. Fresh off its highly promising acquisition of health food brand
Mimi’s Rock, FitLife has acquired all the operating assets of MusclePharm, a fitness supplements
provider. I could not be more excited about this acquisition. With it, FitLife acquires an extremely
well-known brand. MusclePharm was badly managed in recent years, but FitLife has a plan to
restore its distribution and improve margins by favoring direct e-commerce sales over wholesale
distribution. If FitLife can help MusclePharm recover even a fraction of its former revenues, the deal
could double FitLife’s profits. MusclePharm fits neatly into FitLife’s existing supplements business,
even using the same suppliers and manufacturers.
The MusclePharm acquisition is yet another extraordinary deal by CEO Dayton Judd. I expect the
deal to increase FitLife’s free cash flow to $2.50 per share in short order. Shares rose on the deal
news, but still represent great value at $20. FitLife has become a large holding and will likely be
one for quite some time.
TABLE IV: Sector Breakdown, 9/30/23 (%)
I only wish the market were as sanguine
when it comes to another large holding Industrials 21.6
of ours, P10 Inc. After trading to the low Financials 19.4
$13s in August following a strong earnings
Information Technology 16.0
report, shares have retreated all the way to
below $10, a level we last saw in April. Since
Communications 10.3
then, the company has raised an additional
Consumer Discretionary 9.6
$1 billion of fee-paying assets under
management and reduced debt by $18 Consumer Staples 9.6
million. When the company reports earnings
Materials 6.8
in a few weeks, I expect further growth in
AUM and additional debt reduction. Energy 3.6
Real Estate 2.2
The additional assets under management
increase P10’s earnings by around 4.2 cents Health Care 0.9
per share. The debt reduction increases
Utilities 0.0
earnings by an additional cent. Together
these actions result in a 7% increase in P10’s Total 100%
recurring cash flow per share in the last 6
months, but the market has shrugged it off entirely. P10 shares now languish at the lowest ratio of
enterprise value to assets under management since the firm’s IPO in 2021. Blame interest rates,
blame a tougher environment for alternative assets fundraising. I still don’t see why P10 shares
should change hands at 11x free cash flow. Given P10’s highly predictable and recurring revenue
and earnings stream, I view the shares as an “equity bond” with a yield nearing 9%, a yield that will
grow organically at high single digit rates for years on end. Those aren’t easy to find.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

Special Situations
In my last letter, I laid out the case for Logistec Inc., predicting it would be sold and could fetch
at least $90 per share. Good news first: Logistec has a buyer. Now the bad: the sale price is $67
per share, well below what I thought the company would fetch. What gives? Interest rates are
the biggest factor. Since the company announced it would seek a sale last May, Canadian 10-
year yields are up 120 basis points and US 10-year yields are up 100 basis points. The large move
likely resulted in potential buyers moderating their bids or dropping out in the face of a more
challenging funding environment. Faced with accepting the mediocre sale price or continuing with
the status quo, the Paquin Sisters went for the cash. They must really be sick of running a public
entity. Despite the disappointing sale price, the Logistec investment was a success, earning us 30%
in a matter of months. I am sad to see such a unique company exit the public markets, but at least
we made money on Logistec’s way out. We will seek to redeploy the cash invested in Logistec into
other attractive special situations.
Concluding Thoughts
Thank you for reading. I always look forward to the chance to explain my thinking and our
portfolio’s development. Please reach out if you would like to discuss any particular holding or
would appreciate more detail on any aspect of Alluvial Fund. As the fund nears the 7th anniversary
of its founding, I look with pride on what we have accomplished, and remain convinced our best
days, and returns, are ahead of us. Markets rise and fall. There will be ups and downs along the
way. But as long as there is value in the under-explored corners of the market, I’ll be there looking
for it.

Letter to Limited Partners Third Quarter 2023

The cover image shows a map of existing and planned nuclear power reactors
in the US in March, 1973. On the date of this map’s publication, the future mix
of power certainly appeared to include a substantial contribution from nuclear
reactors. However, construction costs and operating reliability issues combined
with changing public attitudes towards nuclear power would see over half of
the planned capacity abandoned or shuttered in the coming decades.
One of the planned plants shown on this map that was ultimately constructed
was the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station. This plant, its reactor is
diagrammed above, is owned by Alluvial Fund holding Talen Energy. Read the
letter to learn more about Talen.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund fell 1.1% in the third quarter. This compares favorably to our benchmarks. The small-
cap Russell 2000 Index produced a total return of -5.2% in the quarter, while the Russell Micro-Cap
Index returned a lamentable -7.9%. Year-to-date, Alluvial fund is up 11.6%, strongly outpacing
comparable indexes. Consistent with the historical pattern, the fund outperformed in this quarter’s
dreary environment thanks to a focus on little-known securities with strong balance sheets and
predictable cash flows. Multiple portfolio holdings reported positive business developments and
healthy earnings, which buoyed shares.

The Backdrop
Much ink has been spilled on the topic of the dismal recent performance of small-cap and micro-
cap stocks. Probably a few tears as well. As I write, the Russell 2000 has given up all its year-to-date
gains and then some. The Russell Micro-Cap Index is dreadful, down 12% in 2023. But wait, it gets
worse! The Russell 2000 is 25% lower than its June 2021 peak and the Russell Micro-Cap Index is
off 40%. Investing in small companies has been nothing short of a slog of late. But while the bear
market may be painful, it is also healthy. From time to time, excesses must be flushed out of the
system. The zero-interest rate era saw numerous companies brought to market with the flimsiest
of business models and dubious chances of generating profits. A big part of this downturn is the
share prices of these dodgy enterprises converging with their intrinsic values. Investors overpaid
for low quality assets and now reality is setting in.
Interest rates are the driving force behind this re-evaluation. Investors may have been happy to
roll the dice on a risky small cap when the opportunity cost was nil. Now that cash earns a safe
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

5%, the casino does not have the same draw. Again, I think this is ultimately a good and healthy
development, but the adjustment is painful. The funding environment is radically different than
it was a year ago. I expect more pain for shareholders of companies that must access meaningful
external capital. The repricing of maturing debt capital will be a headwind for the foreseeable
future.
Fortunately, our portfolio is heavily weighted TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 9/30/23 (%)

holdings and adding a few new ones.
Departing Investments
The fund invested in preferred shares of the Swedish investment company Navigo Invest AB (then
called Pegroco Invest AB) in early 2021. The onset of the COVID crisis led the company to suspend
dividend payments, causing its preferred shares to trade down to well below par. We invested
as signs of an economic recovery were growing, paying around SEK 70 per share. Over the next
two years, the shares recovered and resumed paying dividends. Navigo merged with another
investment company and prepared to list its common shares in Stockholm. With the company back
in good financial health and limited remaining upside, it was time to sell and move on. We exited
our position in Navigo Invest preferreds at around SEK 120, realizing a 30% IRR.
Late in the quarter, we sold our entire position in Wheeler REIT Series L convertible notes. Our
multi-year involvement with the various Wheeler REIT securities was more misadventure than
anything, but we were able to salvage a gain thanks to these notes. At issuance, the Wheeler REIT
notes were potentially convertible into common units at a steep discount to market value, making
the notes immediately worth a large premium to par value. We accumulated a good-sized position,
paying around $30 per note, and have now disposed of them at prices in the low $50s. Over the
last couple of years, I became one of the better-informed market participants on Wheeler REIT, but
I still do not understand this company’s decision-making or ultimate goals. I am more than happy
to wash my hands of the entire situation and find easier and less aggravating ways to earn a good
return on our collective capital.

New Holdings
I have a soft spot for family-run businesses in boring industries far from global financial centers.
Shocker, right? Problem is, many of these businesses are run for insiders, with the idea that
outside investors should be happy with whatever scraps they receive after the “real owners”
are satisfied. Monarch Cement Company is a happy exception. Founded in 1908 in Humboldt,
Kansas, by H.F.G. Wulf, Monarch Cement operates a cement plant with >1 million tons of annual
capacity. Walter H. Wulf, Jr., grandson of the founder, is CEO and chairman. Monarch produces
and distributes Portland Cement and ready-mix concrete across Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa. The
company has a stellar track record of profitability and growth.
Cement is nothing new for Alluvial Fund. We have been happily invested in a similar company,
Boston Sand & Gravel, for several years. In Monarch Cement, I see an opportunity to own another
rare asset with a huge economic moat, at a very attractive price.
Monarch is having a record year thanks to high cement prices and strong demand from
construction and infrastructure projects. Despite strong performance year-to-date, Monarch
Cement shares trade at just 5.5x my estimate of 2023 EBITDA and <10x net income. Monarch
employs no debt and holds a substantial cash and securities portfolio. The company pays a healthy
dividend and regularly repurchases shares. While the cement business is cyclical and Monarch will
have its ups and downs, the current price represents an attractive entry point.
I don’t put a lot of trust in relative valuations, but it’s worth mentioning that Monarch Cement
trades at a 40% discount to most other public cement producers. If the company were sold,
shareholders could expect a very healthy premium. I don’t expect the Wulf family to sell any
time soon. Then again, family-controlled
businesses tend to be “Not for sale!” until

the minute they are. Whatever happens, I

decades to come.
Poland 5.9
We invested in a new post-bankruptcy
United Kingdom 1.6
security in the quarter, Talen Energy Corp.
Talen owns a variety of power generation Denmark 1.4
assets. Its crown jewel is the Susquehanna
Other 0.7
Steam Electric Station, a two-unit nuclear
power plant with 2.5 gigawatts of capacity, Total 100%
enough to power 2 million homes. Talen
sought bankruptcy protection after struggling with excess debt and high hedging costs. The
company emerged from bankruptcy in May, shedding billions in debt. Talen shares currently trade
over-the-counter, but I expect the company to achieve an exchange listing in short order.
Talen has numerous tailwinds that support a much higher share price. The Inflation Reduction
Act passed last year contains supports and subsidies for nuclear power production, essentially
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

providing Talen with a price floor and reducing its hedging costs. The result is a de-risked business
model and a higher justified multiple of earnings and cash flows. Talen’s nuclear plants could be
desirable assets for larger regulated utilities looking to expand their renewables fleets. Acquisition
rumors have swirled, but nothing has materialized yet. In the absence of a transaction, I would not
be surprised to see Talen separate its nuclear assets from its legacy “dirty” natural gas and coal
generation assets. Finally, Talen has a 95% stake in a new data center being built adjacent to the
Susquehanna plant. There is strong interest in data centers powered by renewable energy sources,
and Talen expects to sell the data center or otherwise monetize the asset. I expect Talen will look
much different by this time a year from now, if it is still independent at all.
Next is Hammond Manufacturing Corp. We also own shares of Hammond Power Solutions, but
this is the other Canadian industrial company, run by the other Hammond brother. I hope that
clears things up. Hammond Manufacturing is significantly smaller than Hammond Power Solutions,
but it is consistently profitable, and its products are experiencing a huge growth in demand.
Hammond Manufacturing produces enclosures, cabinets, and racks for electrical applications. It
also produces power distribution products like power strips and small transformers. All products
that have seen great growth in demand thanks to the boom in data center construction, industrial
facilities investment, and electrification.
The strong US Dollar benefits Hammond Manufacturing. About 60% of Hammond’s sales are to
US customers, while its expenses are all in Canadian Dollars. At the current run rate, Hammond
Manufacturing shares trade at less than 5 times earnings. Free cash flow has been low of late as
the company rebuilt depleted inventories and finished construction on a new facility in Palmerston,
Ontario. Now that these investments are complete, I expect the company will focus on reducing
debt and rewarding shareholders.
Finally, we have built a position in Seneca Foods. Seneca is a supplier of possibly the least
glamorous product around: canned vegetables. I actually prefer the taste of certain canned
veggies over fresh or frozen, but that seems to be an unpopular opinion. Still, there is a large
market for canned vegetables, which appeal to the budget-conscious consumer. The market values
Seneca like a relic in irreversible decline. That’s why shares trade at half of tangible book value
and below net current asset value. I happen to think Seneca is in substantially better shape than
the market believes, thanks to changes in the market structure of the canned vegetables industry.
Simply put, there is only so much profit to go around in a mature market. Seneca earned a good
share of those profits until Del Monte, in a bid for market share, cut prices and bought a small,
struggling producer. This went poorly for Del Monte, which ultimately chose to exit the market,
shutting down some packing plants and selling others, including to Seneca Foods. Since Del
Monte exited, Seneca’s profits have bounced back. With Del Monte humbled and nobody else
eager to rush in, I expect Seneca to enjoy a lengthy period of healthy profits and stable market
share.
Seneca Foods shares trade at a mid-single digit multiple of 2023 profits. The company’s capital
allocation is reasonably good, with shares outstanding down 22% over the last 5 years and no
major investment missteps. The company’s accounting earnings can be volatile thanks to a quirk
of inventory accounting. Seneca Foods is one of the few remaining public companies to employ
*Image from Logistec’s 2022 Financial Report
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

“LIFO” (last in, first out) inventory valuation, which has the practical effect of understanding the
value of its inventory by $300 million. The LIFO convention results in under-stated earnings in
periods of rising input costs and over-stated earnings when input costs are falling. Nobody should
mistake Seneca Foods for a growth company or a return on capital standout, but neither should
shares languish at 5x earnings.
Portfolio Updates
FitLife Brands continues to impress. Fresh off its highly promising acquisition of health food brand
Mimi’s Rock, FitLife has acquired all the operating assets of MusclePharm, a fitness supplements
provider. I could not be more excited about this acquisition. With it, FitLife acquires an extremely
well-known brand. MusclePharm was badly managed in recent years, but FitLife has a plan to
restore its distribution and improve margins by favoring direct e-commerce sales over wholesale
distribution. If FitLife can help MusclePharm recover even a fraction of its former revenues, the deal
could double FitLife’s profits. MusclePharm fits neatly into FitLife’s existing supplements business,
even using the same suppliers and manufacturers.
The MusclePharm acquisition is yet another extraordinary deal by CEO Dayton Judd. I expect the
deal to increase FitLife’s free cash flow to $2.50 per share in short order. Shares rose on the deal
news, but still represent great value at $20. FitLife has become a large holding and will likely be
one for quite some time.

enterprise value to assets under management since the firm’s IPO in 2021. Blame interest rates,
blame a tougher environment for alternative assets fundraising. I still don’t see why P10 shares
should change hands at 11x free cash flow. Given P10’s highly predictable and recurring revenue
and earnings stream, I view the shares as an “equity bond” with a yield nearing 9%, a yield that will
grow organically at high single digit rates for years on end. Those aren’t easy to find.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2023 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

Special Situations
In my last letter, I laid out the case for Logistec Inc., predicting it would be sold and could fetch
at least $90 per share. Good news first: Logistec has a buyer. Now the bad: the sale price is $67
per share, well below what I thought the company would fetch. What gives? Interest rates are
the biggest factor. Since the company announced it would seek a sale last May, Canadian 10-
year yields are up 120 basis points and US 10-year yields are up 100 basis points. The large move
likely resulted in potential buyers moderating their bids or dropping out in the face of a more
challenging funding environment. Faced with accepting the mediocre sale price or continuing with
the status quo, the Paquin Sisters went for the cash. They must really be sick of running a public
entity. Despite the disappointing sale price, the Logistec investment was a success, earning us 30%
in a matter of months. I am sad to see such a unique company exit the public markets, but at least
we made money on Logistec’s way out. We will seek to redeploy the cash invested in Logistec into
other attractive special situations.
Concluding Thoughts
Thank you for reading. I always look forward to the chance to explain my thinking and our
portfolio’s development. Please reach out if you would like to discuss any particular holding or
would appreciate more detail on any aspect of Alluvial Fund. As the fund nears the 7th anniversary
of its founding, I look with pride on what we have accomplished, and remain convinced our best
days, and returns, are ahead of us. Markets rise and fall. There will be ups and downs along the
way. But as long as there is value in the under-explored corners of the market, I’ll be there looking
for it.

Cedar Creek Partners,Tim Eriksen,"October 20, 2022",2022.0,3.0,13.4,S&P 500,-4.9,18.3,"The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the Fund’s auditors.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown.

All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only.

The Fund’s returns are likely to differ substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results that are superior to such indices.

Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the closing price as of the previous month end.

The NASDAQ declined 4% in the quarter and was down 32% in the first nine months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all down between 0.5 and 6% in the quarter. Other than the DJIA all were down over 20% in the three quarters of 2022. Cedar Creek increased by 13.4% in the third quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was up 2.4% in the first nine months, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 16 and 3/4 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 792.5%, net of fees and expenses.

Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $893,214 as of September 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $244,179 in the Russell Micro Cap and $456,428 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5 times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Weighted price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 1.0%. Weighted return on equity as of September 30, 2022 was 19.3%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 14% and ended the quarter at 4%. The big decrease was primarily due to building large positions in two microcap companies that we think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are trading at less than eight times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow rapidly (more on these two stocks below). If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the fund’s sixteen-year history, they are certainly in the top three! We closed out our position in Rubicon Technology (RBCN) after the announced tender offer by Janel (JANL). We believed the shares were fairly valued and were not interested in holding the stub for three years waiting on Janel to acquire additional shares. We think Janel overpaid for the shares and should not have followed the tender with a large dividend. Rubicon is going to need funds in order to buy another company in order to take advantage of its historical net operating losses. We closed our position in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The attraction was the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern was the contract with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net cash balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share. Harbor earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted from funds from the payroll support program. Harbor announced a new contract with American Airlines, which caused the share price to rise. Despite the new contract with American, we were very concerned about the language in the quarterly earnings report about disputed amounts with United. The growth of the disputed amount in the second quarter was significant and we felt there was a possibility of Harbor not collecting which meant their earnings were much less than reported. Our cost basis was $2.18 per share. We exited between $2.40 and $2.85 per share. Basically we had some doubts and felt more comfortable selling and allocating the cash to our two investments noted below. We did increase our position in BM Technologies (BMTX) which we detailed in our 2022 second quarter letter. We also purchased some of the publicly traded warrants as well. BMTX should benefit from higher interest rates in terms of replacing their agreement with Customers Bancorp (CUBI). Customers currently pays BMTX roughly 3% on deposits that BMTX gains through its BankMobile subisidiary. Once the acquisition of First Sound Bank (FSWA) for $25 million goes through, much of the deposits could be held at the bank and invested in three month treasury bills which currently yield nearly 4.0%, or they could broker the deposits and likely make a similar amount in the current environment. We think the stock is currently trading at less than three times forward cash earnings assuming a 3% yield on deposits, and less than two times cash earnings, net of “excess cash” at BMTX. We used parenthesis on “excess cash” due to there likely be a need for the capital at the bank subsidiary once the acquisition closes. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market held fairly steady in the quarter. These are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of them when they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 22% of the fund. As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 22% of the fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 8% of the fund, Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG), which is neither an oil company or a mortgage company, is 4% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is over 3%. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our 2022 second quarter letter (link). Subsequent to quarter end we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific Coast Oil Trust. We think that the operator, PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust. PCEC’s lawyers contend the Conveyance Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22 (l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement forbids any assessment of costs accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern what pages 7 and 22 refer to). PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation prior to 2009 and did not convey the liability to unitholders per Note 5 (page F-10) of the Offering documents. At that time, it was $22.3 million and should have accreted (compounded) at approximately a 7% rate annually. After ten years of accretion it would be nearly double the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the amount the operator says the assessed ARO obligation was. There is a strong likelihood in our opinion that most, if not all, of the ARO that has been assessed is improper. If so, the potential Bonanza scenario we described in our Q2 letter is more likely - that the operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or $0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its current $13 million market cap and $0.35 per unit price. In addition to that being paid, current distributions would then resume at a run rate of over $.03 to $0.04 per unit per month, or $0.36 to $0.48 annually. Seems like a potential ten bagger. As we said before, time will tell. We have added to the position this month. The Best Investment Opportunity We Have Seen in a While First, I have to thank @dirtcheapstocks on Twitter for bringing this opportunity to my attention. You can find a write up “dirt” released here that came out on October 6 causing a bump in the share prices. Great investment opportunities have an abnormal risk/reward profile. Typically, high reward potential carries high risk. Occasionally there are opportunities where the profile is skewed - a high potential reward without commensurate risk. Charlie Munger has spoken of this related to his investment in the 1970’s in Belridge Oil. It was a California oil producer with massive low risk reserves (380 barrels per share) selling below book value and at less than three times earnings, with a 10% dividend yield. It was a 35 bagger for him in just a few years as the company was sold for $3,665 per share versus his $115 entry price. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, the best investment we have seen in a while is not at that level, but one that is still quite attractive. The fund has taken large positions in two small community banks. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) along with smaller positions in similar banks. All these banks have a skewed risk reward profile. Thanks to funding through Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) these two banks received capital equal to two to three times their book value (or market value). This funding is in the form of perpetual non-cumulative Preferred stock. Thus, the banks have more capital than most banks and are thus able to withstand negative events to a greater degree. Since the funding is in the form of low yielding Preferred stock, the common stockholders have nearly all the upside from the increased earnings potential of the additional capital. The opportunity existed due to the market failing to recognize the value of the ECIP investment for common shareholders. These two banks were trading at six to seven times earnings in early summer, despite having announced months earlier expected receipt of the investments. The additional capital could be used to grow the bank organically. Assuming similar returns on equity as their existing capital, the bank’s earnings potential increased three to four times. Organic growth would take a number of years, but a bank with that kind of potential should not trade at a discount to industry multiples. The capital could also be used for a major cash acquisition, which could double or triple earnings almost immediately. If that were to happen the share prices could match or exceed the earnings growth. We say exceed since a larger community bank is more likely to be valued at a higher earnings multiple than a smaller bank. For maximum bang for the buck, the ECIP recipients should acquire other ECIP recipients since the preferred is only transferrable to a fellow recipient in the first five years (BankFirst (BFCC) appears to be aggressively adopting this model. Hopefully other ECIP banks are paying attention and will follow BankFirst’s lead. If not, BankFirst may soon be offering to buy them.) M&F Bancorp (MFBP) is a North Carolina based bank that has run rate earnings as of the second quarter of $1.85 per share. As we write this the stock is $17.50. There are less than two million shares outstanding. M&F received $80 million of additional capital. Thus, even today, a buyer is paying under ten times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings potential triple if it acquires a bank earning $7 million after merger synergies, or roughly $6 million currently. That is not only very possible, but probable assuming the bank understands what it has in ECIP. There are even more tail winds for M&F that we mention below that will also help propel earnings upward. The fund started buying in June at under $9 per share. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar characteristics. Its shares have jumped a bit due to the write up on twitter I mentioned above. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded last at $23 per share. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank and the parent both file quarterly Call Reports. Both are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first half of 2022 were about $1.60 per share, but that is inflated due to a $1.8 million grant. Q2 EPS excluding the grant were roughly $0.55 per share. Thus, Citizens is also trading at around ten times its earnings run rate. Citizens has additional tailwinds beyond ECIP. The fund started buying in June at $12 per share. In order to be successful a bank needs access to capital, low cost deposits, lending and investment opportunities, and usually some form of additional non-interest fee or trust income. ECIP solved the problem of lack of capital. Amazingly enough, ECIP funds are not the only capital funds some of the CDFI’s have received. Citizens (CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) both received preferred stock investments from money center banks in 2021. Citizens issued $22 million of Preferred Stock in 2021 with just a 1% dividend to major money center banks. M&F issued a total of $17.5 million in Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock to JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank, and also issued 39,600 common shares. The preferred has a low 1% rate; however, it does have a dividend share that gives the preferred a proportionate share in dividend increases. Bank of America has also purchased 5% common equity positions in ten MDI’s and CDFI’s (link). Most are privately held, but the list includes M&F Bancorp (MFBP). Post George Floyd, a number of large corporations announced their intentions to advance racial equality by supporting MDI’s and CDFI’s by putting deposits at those banks. The problem became the bank’s ability to have large deposits from just one customer. JPMorgan created the JP Morgan Empower fund to address that issue. It is an institutional money market fund where 12.5% of the management fee revenue received is directed to specified CDFI’s and MDI’s. The minimum investment is $50 million. Both Citizens and M&F receive funds from this program. If you look at M&F’s income statement under noninterest income you will see a line titled “Commissions from sales of financial products.” This is funds from this program directed to M&F. In Q1 it was $122,000. In Q2 it rose to $231,000. If the trend continues, the Q3 number should be between $300,000 and $350,000. Due to rising interest rates, we would not be surprised if Q4 income approaches $500,000, which would mean a pre-tax run rate of $1 per share from this program alone versus nothing in 2021. Hopefully we are not being too optimistic. As the banks get larger, they will be able to take on larger deposits on their own balance sheets which will allow them to earn multiples of what they currently receive from the JPMorgan program. It is a virtuous cycle – as the banks grow larger, they can take on larger deposits, which allows them to grow larger, etc. The money center banks have also created a program to allow participation by select CDFI’s in loan syndications. There is also the recently formed National Black Bank Foundation, which recently organized a syndication team to structure a deal for the Atlanta Hawks practice facility and complex. Citizens and M&F both participated in the loan. A number of money center banks have also agreed to provide ATM access free of charge to customers at M&F and Citizens. This will allow them to attract deposits outside of their local branch base, as well as lower fees for existing customers who travel. We can envision people intentionally choosing to bank with a CDFI or MDI, which would further grow deposits. In a branchless banking world, why not support a CDFI instead of a large money center bank? Lastly, a number of government programs provide grant income. As we noted above, Citizens received $1.8 million through CDFI Rapid Resource Grant program as well as $5 million from Morgan Stanley in 2020. Even with ECIP funds, we expect the government programs, including the grant programs, to continue. In summary, M&F Bancorp and Citizens Bancshares have obtained: 1. Significant funds via ECIP 2. Preferred stock investments by Money Center Banks 3. Substantial ESG investments (deposits, JP Morgan Empower fund) 4. Participation in Loan syndication with money center banks and National Black Bank Foundation 5. ATM access nationwide with no fees 6. Government and private grants Valuation How should we value the ECIP funding? What is it worth to the banks? We are more income statement focused; therefore, we look at what it could do to earnings and then apply a fair multiple to those earnings. One way is to apply historical return on equity to the ECIP funds less expected dividend rate of 0.5 -2.0%. This requires estimating current earnings run rate and future return on equity once ECIP fully put into use, which should exceed historical return on equity since certain overhead is already covered.

The result is the smaller the bank the better with the proviso that they are already decently profitable. Periodic grant income makes estimating profitability difficult for many of the banks, and Harbor in particular. Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), United Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB), BankFirst (BFCC) and Community Bank of the Bay (CBOBA) stand out the most. Assuming a 10-12x price to earnings ratio would result in a 2 -3x return for those five banks. When we first started buying M&F and Citizens their future P/E was under two times using this approach, which meant we were expecting a 5-6x return within three or four years. Since both have nearly doubled in price, future expected return is no 2-3x over four years. We would stress that the timeframe assumes organic growth. An acquisition can bring the increased earnings almost immediately. Thus, we have a base case of 2-3x in four years, with an upside scenario of 2-3x in one year. Another valuation approach is the balance sheet. The balance sheet investor is typically looking at community banks that sell at a discount to tangible book value. Preferred stock doesn’t impact that; however, since this preferred is potentially redeemable by the bank, it could become common equity in a few years. The Treasury has implemented a number of rules and already provided guidance on a minimum repurchase price. Without permission, only another MDI or CDFI can buy a CDFI and rollover the preferred. What is interesting is that the Treasury has said it may sell the preferred down the road, and when it does the bank will have the opportunity to match an offer. The price will not be below 10% of face value. Yes, you read that right. Treasury already recognizes that the fair value of the preferred is a fraction of face value. A simple discounted cash flow comparing the preferred to the market price of bank preferred with a hypothetical 7.5% yield will result in a fair value of 10-25% of face value, thus the bank (i.e. common shareholder) is essentially being gifted 75-90% of the face value of the preferred. The balance sheet investor could add that amount to tangible book to get a ballpark estimate of fair value.

Using this metric, the five most attractive are Harbor (HRBR), Broadway Financial (BYFC), Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), and Merchants & Marine (MNMB). We have not spent equivalent amounts of time on each of these banks. We have primarily focused on M&F and Citizens. There may be benefits in some of the others we are not aware of, as well as risks. Our rough estimate of their earnings may not be accurate. With any investment there is risk. Buying banks in a rising interest rate environment is typically not ideal. While we do have the additional capital protection courtesy of the ECIP funds, there are still a number of risks, including: 1. rates paid on deposits approach or exceed rates paid on historical loans 2. mark to market on securities portfolios results in significant decreases to tangible book value 3. increase in troubled loans, particularly since many borrowers have moderate incomes. 4. poor capital allocation Another reason we like M&F Bancorp and Citizens is they have relatively small securities portfolios that have to be marked to market and large cash and deposits at other banks. Citizens had $360 million in cash and deposits versus its $832 million of assets. A ridiculous 43% of assets. That is a lot of capital that can be deployed at higher rates, whether 4% Treasury bills or 7% mortgages. M&F Bancorp had $135 million in cash versus $450 million in assets. While still an attractive amount, it is 1/3 less percentage wise than what Citizens had. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Continued high single digit inflation and increasing interest rates led to a modest market
decline in the third quarter. The NASDAQ declined 4% in the quarter and was down 32% in
the first nine months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all
down between 0.5 and 6% in the quarter. Other than the DJIA all were down over 20% in
the three quarters of 2022. Cedar Creek increased by 13.4% in the third quarter, net of
fees and expenses, and was up 2.4% in the first nine months, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 16 and 3/4 year history is 14.0%, net of fees
and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 792.5%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘22 ’22 YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 13.4% 2.4% 793.2% 14.0%
NASDAQ -4.1% -32.4% 356.4% 9.5%
DJIA (DIA) -6.2% -19.8% 285.3% 8.4%
S&P 500 (SPY) -4.9% -23.9% 284.9% 8.4%
Russell 2000 -2.2% -25.1% 194.1% 6.7%
Russell Microcap -0.5% -25.5% 144.2% 5.5%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $893,214
as of September 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $244,179 in the Russell
Micro Cap and $456,428 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading
at less than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5 times
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.3.
Dividend yield was 1.0%. Weighted return on equity as of September 30, 2022 was
19.3%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 14% and ended the quarter at 4%. The big
decrease was primarily due to building large positions in two microcap companies that we
think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are trading at less than eight
times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow rapidly (more on these two stocks
below). If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the fund’s sixteen-
year history, they are certainly in the top three!
We closed out our position in Rubicon Technology (RBCN) after the announced tender
offer by Janel (JANL). We believed the shares were fairly valued and were not interested
in holding the stub for three years waiting on Janel to acquire additional shares. We think
Janel overpaid for the shares and should not have followed the tender with a large dividend.
Rubicon is going to need funds in order to buy another company in order to take advantage
of its historical net operating losses.
We closed our position in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the
holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The
attraction was the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern was the
contract with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net
cash balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share.
Harbor earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted
from funds from the payroll support program. Harbor announced a new contract with
American Airlines, which caused the share price to rise. Despite the new contract with
American, we were very concerned about the language in the quarterly earnings report
about disputed amounts with United. The growth of the disputed amount in the second
quarter was significant and we felt there was a possibility of Harbor not collecting which
meant their earnings were much less than reported. Our cost basis was $2.18 per share.
We exited between $2.40 and $2.85 per share. Basically we had some doubts and felt
more comfortable selling and allocating the cash to our two investments noted below.
We did increase our position in BM Technologies (BMTX) which we detailed in our 2022
second quarter letter. We also purchased some of the publicly traded warrants as well.
BMTX should benefit from higher interest rates in terms of replacing their agreement with
Customers Bancorp (CUBI). Customers currently pays BMTX roughly 3% on deposits that
BMTX gains through its BankMobile subisidiary. Once the acquisition of First Sound Bank
(FSWA) for $25 million goes through, much of the deposits could be held at the bank and
invested in three month treasury bills which currently yield nearly 4.0%, or they could
broker the deposits and likely make a similar amount in the current environment. We
think the stock is currently trading at less than three times forward cash earnings assuming
a 3% yield on deposits, and less than two times cash earnings, net of “excess cash” at
BMTX. We used parenthesis on “excess cash” due to there likely be a need for the capital
at the bank subsidiary once the acquisition closes.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market held fairly steady in the quarter. These
are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents
brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts
transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of
them when they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 22%
of the fund.
As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 22% of the
fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 8% of the fund, Mortgage Oil Company
(MGAG), which is neither an oil company or a mortgage company, is 4% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is over 3%. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly
in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter, and Pacific Coast Oil
Trust in our 2022 second quarter letter (link).
Subsequent to quarter end we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific
Coast Oil Trust. We think that the operator, PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset
Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust. PCEC’s lawyers contend the Conveyance
Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22 (l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement
forbids any assessment of costs accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern
what pages 7 and 22 refer to). PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation prior to 2009
and did not convey the liability to unitholders per Note 5 (page F-10) of the Offering
documents. At that time, it was $22.3 million and should have accreted (compounded) at
approximately a 7% rate annually. After ten years of accretion it would be nearly double
the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the amount the operator says the assessed ARO
obligation was. There is a strong likelihood in our opinion that most, if not all, of the ARO
that has been assessed is improper. If so, the potential Bonanza scenario we described in
our Q2 letter is more likely - that the operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or
$0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its current $13 million market cap and $0.35 per unit price.
In addition to that being paid, current distributions would then resume at a run rate of over
$.03 to $0.04 per unit per month, or $0.36 to $0.48 annually. Seems like a potential ten
bagger. As we said before, time will tell. We have added to the position this month.
The Best Investment Opportunity We Have Seen in a While
First, I have to thank @dirtcheapstocks on Twitter for bringing this opportunity to my
attention. You can find a write up “dirt” released here that came out on October 6 causing
a bump in the share prices.
Great investment opportunities have an abnormal risk/reward profile. Typically, high
reward potential carries high risk. Occasionally there are opportunities where the profile is
skewed - a high potential reward without commensurate risk. Charlie Munger has spoken
of this related to his investment in the 1970’s in Belridge Oil. It was a California oil
producer with massive low risk reserves (380 barrels per share) selling below book value
and at less than three times earnings, with a 10% dividend yield. It was a 35 bagger for
him in just a few years as the company was sold for $3,665 per share versus his $115
entry price. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, the best investment we
have seen in a while is not at that level, but one that is still quite attractive.
The fund has taken large positions in two small community banks. Citizens Bancshares
(CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) along with smaller positions in similar banks. All these
banks have a skewed risk reward profile. Thanks to funding through Emergency Capital

Investment Program (ECIP) these two banks received capital equal to two to three times
their book value (or market value).3 This funding is in the form of perpetual non-
cumulative Preferred stock. 4 Thus, the banks have more capital than most banks and are
thus able to withstand negative events to a greater degree. Since the funding is in the
form of low yielding Preferred stock, the common stockholders have nearly all the upside
from the increased earnings potential of the additional capital.
The opportunity existed due to the market failing to recognize the value of the ECIP
investment for common shareholders. These two banks were trading at six to seven times
earnings in early summer, despite having announced months earlier expected receipt of the
investments. The additional capital could be used to grow the bank organically. Assuming
similar returns on equity as their existing capital, the bank’s earnings potential increased
three to four times. Organic growth would take a number of years, but a bank with that
kind of potential should not trade at a discount to industry multiples. The capital could also
be used for a major cash acquisition, which could double or triple earnings almost
immediately. If that were to happen the share prices could match or exceed the earnings
growth. We say exceed since a larger community bank is more likely to be valued at a
higher earnings multiple than a smaller bank. For maximum bang for the buck, the ECIP
recipients should acquire other ECIP recipients since the preferred is only transferrable to a
fellow recipient in the first five years (BankFirst (BFCC) appears to be aggressively
3 The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) was part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The
Act was a $2.3 trillion spending bill, which combined $900 billion of stimulus spending and a $1.4 trillion of
omnibus spending bill for the 2021 fiscal spending year, signed into law by President Trump on December 27,
2020. It included stimulus checks for most Americans, extended unemployment benefits, funding for second round
of PPP loans, funds for schools and vaccines along with regular appropriations. Included in the bill was $9 billion
for ECIP.
The US Department of Treasury website states that ECIP “was created to encourage low- and moderate-income
community financial institutions to augment their efforts to support small businesses and consumers in their
communities. Under the program, Treasury will provide up to $9 billion in capital directly to depository institutions
that are certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) or minority depository institutions
(MDIs) to, among other things, provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned
businesses, and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities, that may be disproportionately
impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Treasury will set aside $2 billion for CDFIs and
MDIs with less than $500 million in assets and an additional $2 billion for CDFIs and MDIs with less than $2
billion in assets.”
The maximum amount any CDFI or MDI could receive was $250 million. Institutions with assets in excess of $2
billion were limited to receiving 7.5% of assets. Those between $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion were limited to 15% of
assets. Lastly, those under $0.5 billion were eligible for up to 22.5% of assets. A typical bank has equity equal to
approximately 7-10% of assets, thus larger banks received an amount nearly equal to their existing equity, medium
size banks roughly twice, and smaller banks three times their equity. (The tilt toward smaller banks made them the
most attractive as investments in our opinion.)
4 Perpetual noncumulative preferred stock means that the stock does not have a designated redemption timeframe.
It lasts, in theory, in perpetuity. Noncumulative means any missed dividends do not have to be recouped. They are
just skipped. Preferred stock is part of equity, thus counting in terms of Tier 1 capital ratios. Preferred stock
dividend payments are not deductible to the bank.
The dividend rate is zero for the first two years. After year two it will vary based on how much the bank increases
its qualified lending to low- and middle-income borrowers. Between year three and ten, if lending increases less
than 200% of baseline pre-COVID lending amount (i.e., 2019 levels) the dividend rate will be 2%. If qualified
lending increases between 200% and 400%, the rate will be 1.25%. If it increases greater than 400% it will be
0.5%. After year 10 the rate is fixed based on average annual lending increase in years 2 through 10 (see 8/11/2021
Senior Preferred Term Sheet at https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-small-
businesses/emergency-capital-investment-program).

adopting this model. Hopefully other ECIP banks are paying attention and will follow
BankFirst’s lead. If not, BankFirst may soon be offering to buy them.)
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) is a North Carolina based bank that has run rate earnings as of the
second quarter of $1.85 per share. As we write this the stock is $17.50. There are less
than two million shares outstanding. M&F received $80 million of additional capital. Thus,
even today, a buyer is paying under ten times earnings for a bank with the potential to see
earnings potential triple if it acquires a bank earning $7 million after merger synergies, or
roughly $6 million currently. That is not only very possible, but probable assuming the
bank understands what it has in ECIP. There are even more tail winds for M&F that we
mention below that will also help propel earnings upward. The fund started buying in June
at under $9 per share.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar
characteristics. Its shares have jumped a bit due to the write up on twitter I mentioned
above. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded last at $23 per
share. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital. Citizens does not report
quarterly earnings, but the bank and the parent both file quarterly Call Reports. Both are
available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first half of 2022 were about $1.60 per
share, but that is inflated due to a $1.8 million grant. Q2 EPS excluding the grant were
roughly $0.55 per share. Thus, Citizens is also trading at around ten times its earnings run
rate. Citizens has additional tailwinds beyond ECIP. The fund started buying in June at
$12 per share.
In order to be successful a bank needs access to capital, low cost deposits, lending and
investment opportunities, and usually some form of additional non-interest fee or trust
income. ECIP solved the problem of lack of capital.
Amazingly enough, ECIP funds are not the only capital funds some of the CDFI’s have
received. Citizens (CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) both received preferred stock
investments from money center banks in 2021. Citizens issued $22 million of Preferred
Stock in 2021 with just a 1% dividend to major money center banks. M&F issued a total of
$17.5 million in Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock to JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells
Fargo and Citibank, and also issued 39,600 common shares. The preferred has a low 1%
rate; however, it does have a dividend share that gives the preferred a proportionate share
in dividend increases. Bank of America has also purchased 5% common equity positions in
ten MDI’s and CDFI’s (link). Most are privately held, but the list includes M&F Bancorp
(MFBP).
Post George Floyd, a number of large corporations announced their intentions to advance
racial equality by supporting MDI’s and CDFI’s by putting deposits at those banks. The
problem became the bank’s ability to have large deposits from just one customer.
JPMorgan created the JP Morgan Empower fund to address that issue. It is an institutional
money market fund where 12.5% of the management fee revenue received is directed to
specified CDFI’s and MDI’s. The minimum investment is $50 million. Both Citizens and
M&F receive funds from this program. If you look at M&F’s income statement under
noninterest income you will see a line titled “Commissions from sales of financial products.”
This is funds from this program directed to M&F. In Q1 it was $122,000. In Q2 it rose to
$231,000. If the trend continues, the Q3 number should be between $300,000 and
$350,000. Due to rising interest rates, we would not be surprised if Q4 income approaches
$500,000, which would mean a pre-tax run rate of $1 per share from this program alone
versus nothing in 2021. Hopefully we are not being too optimistic.
As the banks get larger, they will be able to take on larger deposits on their own balance
sheets which will allow them to earn multiples of what they currently receive from the

JPMorgan program. It is a virtuous cycle – as the banks grow larger, they can take on
larger deposits, which allows them to grow larger, etc.
The money center banks have also created a program to allow participation by select CDFI’s
in loan syndications. There is also the recently formed National Black Bank Foundation,
which recently organized a syndication team to structure a deal for the Atlanta Hawks
practice facility and complex. Citizens and M&F both participated in the loan.
A number of money center banks have also agreed to provide ATM access free of charge to
customers at M&F and Citizens. This will allow them to attract deposits outside of their
local branch base, as well as lower fees for existing customers who travel. We can envision
people intentionally choosing to bank with a CDFI or MDI, which would further grow
deposits. In a branchless banking world, why not support a CDFI instead of a large money
center bank?
Lastly, a number of government programs provide grant income. As we noted above,
Citizens received $1.8 million through CDFI Rapid Resource Grant program as well as $5
million from Morgan Stanley in 2020. Even with ECIP funds, we expect the government
programs, including the grant programs, to continue.
In summary, M&F Bancorp and Citizens Bancshares have obtained:
1. Significant funds via ECIP
2. Preferred stock investments by Money Center Banks
3. Substantial ESG investments (deposits, JP Morgan Empower fund)
4. Participation in Loan syndication with money center banks and National Black Bank
Foundation
5. ATM access nationwide with no fees
6. Government and private grants
Valuation
How should we value the ECIP funding? What is it worth to the banks? We are more
income statement focused; therefore, we look at what it could do to earnings and then
apply a fair multiple to those earnings. One way is to apply historical return on equity to the
ECIP funds less expected dividend rate of 0.5 -2.0%. This requires estimating current
earnings run rate and future return on equity once ECIP fully put into use, which should
exceed historical return on equity since certain overhead is already covered.

ECIP amount in millions.

The result is the smaller the bank the better with the proviso that they are already decently
profitable. Periodic grant income makes estimating profitability difficult for many of the
banks, and Harbor in particular. Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), United
Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB), BankFirst (BFCC) and Community Bank of the Bay
(CBOBA) stand out the most. Assuming a 10-12x price to earnings ratio would result in a 2
-3x return for those five banks. When we first started buying M&F and Citizens their future
P/E was under two times using this approach, which meant we were expecting a 5-6x
return within three or four years. Since both have nearly doubled in price, future expected
return is no 2-3x over four years. We would stress that the timeframe assumes organic
growth. An acquisition can bring the increased earnings almost immediately. Thus, we
have a base case of 2-3x in four years, with an upside scenario of 2-3x in one year.
Another valuation approach is the balance sheet. The balance sheet investor is typically
looking at community banks that sell at a discount to tangible book value. Preferred stock
doesn’t impact that; however, since this preferred is potentially redeemable by the bank, it
could become common equity in a few years. The Treasury has implemented a number of
rules and already provided guidance on a minimum repurchase price. Without permission,
only another MDI or CDFI can buy a CDFI and rollover the preferred. What is interesting is
that the Treasury has said it may sell the preferred down the road, and when it does the
bank will have the opportunity to match an offer. The price will not be below 10% of face
value. Yes, you read that right. Treasury already recognizes that the fair value of the
preferred is a fraction of face value. A simple discounted cash flow comparing the preferred
to the market price of bank preferred with a hypothetical 7.5% yield will result in a fair
value of 10-25% of face value, thus the bank (i.e. common shareholder) is essentially being
gifted 75-90% of the face value of the preferred. The balance sheet investor could add that
amount to tangible book to get a ballpark estimate of fair value.

Market Cap, book value, and ECIP Approval amount in millions.
Using this metric, the five most attractive are Harbor (HRBR), Broadway Financial (BYFC),
Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), and Merchants & Marine (MNMB). We have not
spent equivalent amounts of time on each of these banks. We have primarily focused on
M&F and Citizens. There may be benefits in some of the others we are not aware of, as
well as risks. Our rough estimate of their earnings may not be accurate.
With any investment there is risk. Buying banks in a rising interest rate environment is
typically not ideal. While we do have the additional capital protection courtesy of the ECIP
funds, there are still a number of risks, including:
1. rates paid on deposits approach or exceed rates paid on historical loans

2. mark to market on securities portfolios results in significant decreases to tangible book
value
3. increase in troubled loans, particularly since many borrowers have moderate incomes.
4. poor capital allocation
Another reason we like M&F Bancorp and Citizens is they have relatively small securities
portfolios that have to be marked to market and large cash and deposits at other banks.
Citizens had $360 million in cash and deposits versus its $832 million of assets. A
ridiculous 43% of assets. That is a lot of capital that can be deployed at higher rates,
whether 4% Treasury bills or 7% mortgages. M&F Bancorp had $135 million in cash versus
$450 million in assets. While still an attractive amount, it is 1/3 less percentage wise than
what Citizens had.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider
referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are
1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high
net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The NASDAQ declined 4% in the quarter and was down 32% in the first nine months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all down between 0.5 and 6% in the quarter. Other than the DJIA all were down over 20% in the three quarters of 2022. Cedar Creek increased by 13.4% in the third quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was up 2.4% in the first nine months, net of fees and expenses. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 16 and 3/4 year history is 14.0%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 792.5%, net of fees and expenses. Q3 ‘22 ’22 YTD Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 13.4% 2.4% 793.2% 14.0% NASDAQ -4.1% -32.4% 356.4% 9.5% DJIA (DIA) -6.2% -19.8% 285.3% 8.4% S&P 500 (SPY) -4.9% -23.9% 284.9% 8.4% Russell 2000 -2.2% -25.1% 194.1% 6.7% Russell Microcap -0.5% -25.5% 144.2% 5.5% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $893,214 as of September 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $244,179 in the Russell Micro Cap and $456,428 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of September 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5 times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Weighted price to book was 1.3. Dividend yield was 1.0%. Weighted return on equity as of September 30, 2022 was 19.3%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 14% and ended the quarter at 4%. The big decrease was primarily due to building large positions in two microcap companies that we think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are trading at less than eight times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow rapidly (more on these two stocks below). If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the fund’s sixteen-year history, they are certainly in the top three! We closed out our position in Rubicon Technology (RBCN) after the announced tender offer by Janel (JANL). We believed the shares were fairly valued and were not interested in holding the stub for three years waiting on Janel to acquire additional shares. We think Janel overpaid for the shares and should not have followed the tender with a large dividend. Rubicon is going to need funds in order to buy another company in order to take advantage of its historical net operating losses. We closed our position in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The attraction was the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern was the contract with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net cash balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share. Harbor earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted from funds from the payroll support program. Harbor announced a new contract with American Airlines, which caused the share price to rise. Despite the new contract with American, we were very concerned about the language in the quarterly earnings report about disputed amounts with United. The growth of the disputed amount in the second quarter was significant and we felt there was a possibility of Harbor not collecting which meant their earnings were much less than reported. Our cost basis was $2.18 per share. We exited between $2.40 and $2.85 per share. Basically we had some doubts and felt more comfortable selling and allocating the cash to our two investments noted below. We did increase our position in BM Technologies (BMTX) which we detailed in our 2022 second quarter letter. We also purchased some of the publicly traded warrants as well. BMTX should benefit from higher interest rates in terms of replacing their agreement with Customers Bancorp (CUBI). Customers currently pays BMTX roughly 3% on deposits that BMTX gains through its BankMobile subisidiary. Once the acquisition of First Sound Bank (FSWA) for $25 million goes through, much of the deposits could be held at the bank and invested in three month treasury bills which currently yield nearly 4.0%, or they could broker the deposits and likely make a similar amount in the current environment. We think the stock is currently trading at less than three times forward cash earnings assuming a 3% yield on deposits, and less than two times cash earnings, net of “excess cash” at BMTX. We used parenthesis on “excess cash” due to there likely be a need for the capital at the bank subsidiary once the acquisition closes. Expert Market Exposure Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market held fairly steady in the quarter. These are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of them when they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 22% of the fund. As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 22% of the fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 8% of the fund, Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG), which is neither an oil company or a mortgage company, is 4% of the fund, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is over 3%. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter, and Pacific Coast Oil Trust in our 2022 second quarter letter (link). Subsequent to quarter end we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific Coast Oil Trust. We think that the operator, PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust. PCEC’s lawyers contend the Conveyance Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22 (l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement forbids any assessment of costs accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern what pages 7 and 22 refer to). PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation prior to 2009 and did not convey the liability to unitholders per Note 5 (page F-10) of the Offering documents. At that time, it was $22.3 million and should have accreted (compounded) at approximately a 7% rate annually. After ten years of accretion it would be nearly double the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the amount the operator says the assessed ARO obligation was. There is a strong likelihood in our opinion that most, if not all, of the ARO that has been assessed is improper. If so, the potential Bonanza scenario we described in our Q2 letter is more likely - that the operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or $0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its current $13 million market cap and $0.35 per unit price. In addition to that being paid, current distributions would then resume at a run rate of over $.03 to $0.04 per unit per month, or $0.36 to $0.48 annually. Seems like a potential ten bagger. As we said before, time will tell. We have added to the position this month. The Best Investment Opportunity We Have Seen in a While First, I have to thank @dirtcheapstocks on Twitter for bringing this opportunity to my attention. You can find a write up “dirt” released here that came out on October 6 causing a bump in the share prices. Great investment opportunities have an abnormal risk/reward profile. Typically, high reward potential carries high risk. Occasionally there are opportunities where the profile is skewed - a high potential reward without commensurate risk. Charlie Munger has spoken of this related to his investment in the 1970’s in Belridge Oil. It was a California oil producer with massive low risk reserves (380 barrels per share) selling below book value and at less than three times earnings, with a 10% dividend yield. It was a 35 bagger for him in just a few years as the company was sold for $3,665 per share versus his $115 entry price. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, the best investment we have seen in a while is not at that level, but one that is still quite attractive. The fund has taken large positions in two small community banks. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) along with smaller positions in similar banks. All these banks have a skewed risk reward profile. Thanks to funding through Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) these two banks received capital equal to two to three times their book value (or market value). This funding is in the form of perpetual non-cumulative Preferred stock. Thus, the banks have more capital than most banks and are thus able to withstand negative events to a greater degree. Since the funding is in the form of low yielding Preferred stock, the common stockholders have nearly all the upside from the increased earnings potential of the additional capital. The opportunity existed due to the market failing to recognize the value of the ECIP investment for common shareholders. These two banks were trading at six to seven times earnings in early summer, despite having announced months earlier expected receipt of the investments. The additional capital could be used to grow the bank organically. Assuming similar returns on equity as their existing capital, the bank’s earnings potential increased three to four times. Organic growth would take a number of years, but a bank with that kind of potential should not trade at a discount to industry multiples. The capital could also be used for a major cash acquisition, which could double or triple earnings almost immediately. If that were to happen the share prices could match or exceed the earnings growth. We say exceed since a larger community bank is more likely to be valued at a higher earnings multiple than a smaller bank. For maximum bang for the buck, the ECIP recipients should acquire other ECIP recipients since the preferred is only transferrable to a fellow recipient in the first five years (BankFirst (BFCC) appears to be aggressively adopting this model. Hopefully other ECIP banks are paying attention and will follow BankFirst’s lead. If not, BankFirst may soon be offering to buy them.) M&F Bancorp (MFBP) is a North Carolina based bank that has run rate earnings as of the second quarter of $1.85 per share. As we write this the stock is $17.50. There are less than two million shares outstanding. M&F received $80 million of additional capital. Thus, even today, a buyer is paying under ten times earnings for a bank with the potential to see earnings potential triple if it acquires a bank earning $7 million after merger synergies, or roughly $6 million currently. That is not only very possible, but probable assuming the bank understands what it has in ECIP. There are even more tail winds for M&F that we mention below that will also help propel earnings upward. The fund started buying in June at under $9 per share. Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar characteristics. Its shares have jumped a bit due to the write up on twitter I mentioned above. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded last at $23 per share. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital. Citizens does not report quarterly earnings, but the bank and the parent both file quarterly Call Reports. Both are available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first half of 2022 were about $1.60 per share, but that is inflated due to a $1.8 million grant. Q2 EPS excluding the grant were roughly $0.55 per share. Thus, Citizens is also trading at around ten times its earnings run rate. Citizens has additional tailwinds beyond ECIP. The fund started buying in June at $12 per share. In order to be successful a bank needs access to capital, low cost deposits, lending and investment opportunities, and usually some form of additional non-interest fee or trust income. ECIP solved the problem of lack of capital. Amazingly enough, ECIP funds are not the only capital funds some of the CDFI’s have received. Citizens (CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) both received preferred stock investments from money center banks in 2021. Citizens issued $22 million of Preferred Stock in 2021 with just a 1% dividend to major money center banks. M&F issued a total of $17.5 million in Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock to JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank, and also issued 39,600 common shares. The preferred has a low 1% rate; however, it does have a dividend share that gives the preferred a proportionate share in dividend increases. Bank of America has also purchased 5% common equity positions in ten MDI’s and CDFI’s (link). Most are privately held, but the list includes M&F Bancorp (MFBP). Post George Floyd, a number of large corporations announced their intentions to advance racial equality by supporting MDI’s and CDFI’s by putting deposits at those banks. The problem became the bank’s ability to have large deposits from just one customer. JPMorgan created the JP Morgan Empower fund to address that issue. It is an institutional money market fund where 12.5% of the management fee revenue received is directed to specified CDFI’s and MDI’s. The minimum investment is $50 million. Both Citizens and M&F receive funds from this program. If you look at M&F’s income statement under noninterest income you will see a line titled “Commissions from sales of financial products.” This is funds from this program directed to M&F. In Q1 it was $122,000. In Q2 it rose to $231,000. If the trend continues, the Q3 number should be between $300,000 and $350,000. Due to rising interest rates, we would not be surprised if Q4 income approaches $500,000, which would mean a pre-tax run rate of $1 per share from this program alone versus nothing in 2021. Hopefully we are not being too optimistic. As the banks get larger, they will be able to take on larger deposits on their own balance sheets which will allow them to earn multiples of what they currently receive from the JPMorgan program. It is a virtuous cycle – as the banks grow larger, they can take on larger deposits, which allows them to grow larger, etc. The money center banks have also created a program to allow participation by select CDFI’s in loan syndications. There is also the recently formed National Black Bank Foundation, which recently organized a syndication team to structure a deal for the Atlanta Hawks practice facility and complex. Citizens and M&F both participated in the loan. A number of money center banks have also agreed to provide ATM access free of charge to customers at M&F and Citizens. This will allow them to attract deposits outside of their local branch base, as well as lower fees for existing customers who travel. We can envision people intentionally choosing to bank with a CDFI or MDI, which would further grow deposits. In a branchless banking world, why not support a CDFI instead of a large money center bank? Lastly, a number of government programs provide grant income. As we noted above, Citizens received $1.8 million through CDFI Rapid Resource Grant program as well as $5 million from Morgan Stanley in 2020. Even with ECIP funds, we expect the government programs, including the grant programs, to continue. In summary, M&F Bancorp and Citizens Bancshares have obtained: 1. Significant funds via ECIP 2. Preferred stock investments by Money Center Banks 3. Substantial ESG investments (deposits, JP Morgan Empower fund) 4. Participation in Loan syndication with money center banks and National Black Bank Foundation 5. ATM access nationwide with no fees 6. Government and private grants Valuation How should we value the ECIP funding? What is it worth to the banks? We are more income statement focused; therefore, we look at what it could do to earnings and then apply a fair multiple to those earnings. One way is to apply historical return on equity to the ECIP funds less expected dividend rate of 0.5 -2.0%. This requires estimating current earnings run rate and future return on equity once ECIP fully put into use, which should exceed historical return on equity since certain overhead is already covered.

The result is the smaller the bank the better with the proviso that they are already decently profitable. Periodic grant income makes estimating profitability difficult for many of the banks, and Harbor in particular. Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), United Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB), BankFirst (BFCC) and Community Bank of the Bay (CBOBA) stand out the most. Assuming a 10-12x price to earnings ratio would result in a 2 -3x return for those five banks. When we first started buying M&F and Citizens their future P/E was under two times using this approach, which meant we were expecting a 5-6x return within three or four years. Since both have nearly doubled in price, future expected return is no 2-3x over four years. We would stress that the timeframe assumes organic growth. An acquisition can bring the increased earnings almost immediately. Thus, we have a base case of 2-3x in four years, with an upside scenario of 2-3x in one year. Another valuation approach is the balance sheet. The balance sheet investor is typically looking at community banks that sell at a discount to tangible book value. Preferred stock doesn’t impact that; however, since this preferred is potentially redeemable by the bank, it could become common equity in a few years. The Treasury has implemented a number of rules and already provided guidance on a minimum repurchase price. Without permission, only another MDI or CDFI can buy a CDFI and rollover the preferred. What is interesting is that the Treasury has said it may sell the preferred down the road, and when it does the bank will have the opportunity to match an offer. The price will not be below 10% of face value. Yes, you read that right. Treasury already recognizes that the fair value of the preferred is a fraction of face value. A simple discounted cash flow comparing the preferred to the market price of bank preferred with a hypothetical 7.5% yield will result in a fair value of 10-25% of face value, thus the bank (i.e. common shareholder) is essentially being gifted 75-90% of the face value of the preferred. The balance sheet investor could add that amount to tangible book to get a ballpark estimate of fair value.

Using this metric, the five most attractive are Harbor (HRBR), Broadway Financial (BYFC), Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), and Merchants & Marine (MNMB). We have not spent equivalent amounts of time on each of these banks. We have primarily focused on M&F and Citizens. There may be benefits in some of the others we are not aware of, as well as risks. Our rough estimate of their earnings may not be accurate. With any investment there is risk. Buying banks in a rising interest rate environment is typically not ideal. While we do have the additional capital protection courtesy of the ECIP funds, there are still a number of risks, including: 1. rates paid on deposits approach or exceed rates paid on historical loans 2. mark to market on securities portfolios results in significant decreases to tangible book value 3. increase in troubled loans, particularly since many borrowers have moderate incomes. 4. poor capital allocation Another reason we like M&F Bancorp and Citizens is they have relatively small securities portfolios that have to be marked to market and large cash and deposits at other banks. Citizens had $360 million in cash and deposits versus its $832 million of assets. A ridiculous 43% of assets. That is a lot of capital that can be deployed at higher rates, whether 4% Treasury bills or 7% mortgages. M&F Bancorp had $135 million in cash versus $450 million in assets. While still an attractive amount, it is 1/3 less percentage wise than what Citizens had. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 Third Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Continued high single digit inflation and increasing interest rates led to a modest market
decline in the third quarter. The NASDAQ declined 4% in the quarter and was down 32% in
the first nine months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all
down between 0.5 and 6% in the quarter. Other than the DJIA all were down over 20% in
the three quarters of 2022. Cedar Creek increased by 13.4% in the third quarter, net of
fees and expenses, and was up 2.4% in the first nine months, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our 16 and 3/4 year history is 14.0%, net of fees
and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 792.5%, net of fees and expenses.
Q3 ‘22 ’22 YTD Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek 13.4% 2.4% 793.2% 14.0%
NASDAQ -4.1% -32.4% 356.4% 9.5%
DJIA (DIA) -6.2% -19.8% 285.3% 8.4%
S&P 500 (SPY) -4.9% -23.9% 284.9% 8.4%
Russell 2000 -2.2% -25.1% 194.1% 6.7%
Russell Microcap -0.5% -25.5% 144.2% 5.5%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $893,214
as of September 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the
indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $244,179 in the Russell
Micro Cap and $456,428 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of September 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading
at less than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and 5 times
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.3.
Dividend yield was 1.0%. Weighted return on equity as of September 30, 2022 was
19.3%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 14% and ended the quarter at 4%. The big
decrease was primarily due to building large positions in two microcap companies that we
think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are trading at less than eight
times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow rapidly (more on these two stocks
below). If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the fund’s sixteen-
year history, they are certainly in the top three!
We closed out our position in Rubicon Technology (RBCN) after the announced tender
offer by Janel (JANL). We believed the shares were fairly valued and were not interested
in holding the stub for three years waiting on Janel to acquire additional shares. We think
Janel overpaid for the shares and should not have followed the tender with a large dividend.
Rubicon is going to need funds in order to buy another company in order to take advantage
of its historical net operating losses.
We closed our position in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the
holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The
attraction was the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern was the
contract with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net
cash balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share.
Harbor earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted
from funds from the payroll support program. Harbor announced a new contract with
American Airlines, which caused the share price to rise. Despite the new contract with
American, we were very concerned about the language in the quarterly earnings report
about disputed amounts with United. The growth of the disputed amount in the second
quarter was significant and we felt there was a possibility of Harbor not collecting which
meant their earnings were much less than reported. Our cost basis was $2.18 per share.
We exited between $2.40 and $2.85 per share. Basically we had some doubts and felt
more comfortable selling and allocating the cash to our two investments noted below.
We did increase our position in BM Technologies (BMTX) which we detailed in our 2022
second quarter letter. We also purchased some of the publicly traded warrants as well.
BMTX should benefit from higher interest rates in terms of replacing their agreement with
Customers Bancorp (CUBI). Customers currently pays BMTX roughly 3% on deposits that
BMTX gains through its BankMobile subisidiary. Once the acquisition of First Sound Bank
(FSWA) for $25 million goes through, much of the deposits could be held at the bank and
invested in three month treasury bills which currently yield nearly 4.0%, or they could
broker the deposits and likely make a similar amount in the current environment. We
think the stock is currently trading at less than three times forward cash earnings assuming
a 3% yield on deposits, and less than two times cash earnings, net of “excess cash” at
BMTX. We used parenthesis on “excess cash” due to there likely be a need for the capital
at the bank subsidiary once the acquisition closes.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

Expert Market Exposure
Our exposure to shares trading in the expert market held fairly steady in the quarter. These
are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents
brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts
transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction. We don’t make the rules, we just try to take advantage of
them when they are stupid. We started the quarter with 22% exposure and ended at 22%
of the fund.
As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 22% of the
fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 8% of the fund, Mortgage Oil Company
(MGAG), which is neither an oil company or a mortgage company, is 4% of the fund, and
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is over 3%. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly
in our Q1 2021 letter, Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter, and Pacific Coast Oil
Trust in our 2022 second quarter letter (link).
Subsequent to quarter end we joined with Shipyard Capital in filing a joint 13D on Pacific
Coast Oil Trust. We think that the operator, PCEC, is improperly trying to assess Asset
Retirement Obligations (ARO) to the trust. PCEC’s lawyers contend the Conveyance
Agreement allows for it (pages 7 (n), 22 (l)). We contend that the Conveyance Agreement
forbids any assessment of costs accrued prior to April 1, 2012 (pages 5, 20 that govern
what pages 7 and 22 refer to). PCEC had already accrued an ARO obligation prior to 2009
and did not convey the liability to unitholders per Note 5 (page F-10) of the Offering
documents. At that time, it was $22.3 million and should have accreted (compounded) at
approximately a 7% rate annually. After ten years of accretion it would be nearly double
the original $22.3 million, which is nearly the amount the operator says the assessed ARO
obligation was. There is a strong likelihood in our opinion that most, if not all, of the ARO
that has been assessed is improper. If so, the potential Bonanza scenario we described in
our Q2 letter is more likely - that the operator owes the trust roughly $25 to $30 million, or
$0.65 to $0.80 per unit, versus its current $13 million market cap and $0.35 per unit price.
In addition to that being paid, current distributions would then resume at a run rate of over
$.03 to $0.04 per unit per month, or $0.36 to $0.48 annually. Seems like a potential ten
bagger. As we said before, time will tell. We have added to the position this month.
The Best Investment Opportunity We Have Seen in a While
First, I have to thank @dirtcheapstocks on Twitter for bringing this opportunity to my
attention. You can find a write up “dirt” released here that came out on October 6 causing
a bump in the share prices.
Great investment opportunities have an abnormal risk/reward profile. Typically, high
reward potential carries high risk. Occasionally there are opportunities where the profile is
skewed - a high potential reward without commensurate risk. Charlie Munger has spoken
of this related to his investment in the 1970’s in Belridge Oil. It was a California oil
producer with massive low risk reserves (380 barrels per share) selling below book value
and at less than three times earnings, with a 10% dividend yield. It was a 35 bagger for
him in just a few years as the company was sold for $3,665 per share versus his $115
entry price. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, the best investment we
have seen in a while is not at that level, but one that is still quite attractive.
The fund has taken large positions in two small community banks. Citizens Bancshares
(CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) along with smaller positions in similar banks. All these
banks have a skewed risk reward profile. Thanks to funding through Emergency Capital

Investment Program (ECIP) these two banks received capital equal to two to three times
their book value (or market value).3 This funding is in the form of perpetual non-
cumulative Preferred stock. 4 Thus, the banks have more capital than most banks and are
thus able to withstand negative events to a greater degree. Since the funding is in the
form of low yielding Preferred stock, the common stockholders have nearly all the upside
from the increased earnings potential of the additional capital.
The opportunity existed due to the market failing to recognize the value of the ECIP
investment for common shareholders. These two banks were trading at six to seven times
earnings in early summer, despite having announced months earlier expected receipt of the
investments. The additional capital could be used to grow the bank organically. Assuming
similar returns on equity as their existing capital, the bank’s earnings potential increased
three to four times. Organic growth would take a number of years, but a bank with that
kind of potential should not trade at a discount to industry multiples. The capital could also
be used for a major cash acquisition, which could double or triple earnings almost
immediately. If that were to happen the share prices could match or exceed the earnings
growth. We say exceed since a larger community bank is more likely to be valued at a
higher earnings multiple than a smaller bank. For maximum bang for the buck, the ECIP
recipients should acquire other ECIP recipients since the preferred is only transferrable to a
fellow recipient in the first five years (BankFirst (BFCC) appears to be aggressively
3 The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) was part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The
Act was a $2.3 trillion spending bill, which combined $900 billion of stimulus spending and a $1.4 trillion of
omnibus spending bill for the 2021 fiscal spending year, signed into law by President Trump on December 27,
2020. It included stimulus checks for most Americans, extended unemployment benefits, funding for second round
of PPP loans, funds for schools and vaccines along with regular appropriations. Included in the bill was $9 billion
for ECIP.
The US Department of Treasury website states that ECIP “was created to encourage low- and moderate-income
community financial institutions to augment their efforts to support small businesses and consumers in their
communities. Under the program, Treasury will provide up to $9 billion in capital directly to depository institutions
that are certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) or minority depository institutions
(MDIs) to, among other things, provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned
businesses, and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities, that may be disproportionately
impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Treasury will set aside $2 billion for CDFIs and
MDIs with less than $500 million in assets and an additional $2 billion for CDFIs and MDIs with less than $2
billion in assets.”
The maximum amount any CDFI or MDI could receive was $250 million. Institutions with assets in excess of $2
billion were limited to receiving 7.5% of assets. Those between $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion were limited to 15% of
assets. Lastly, those under $0.5 billion were eligible for up to 22.5% of assets. A typical bank has equity equal to
approximately 7-10% of assets, thus larger banks received an amount nearly equal to their existing equity, medium
size banks roughly twice, and smaller banks three times their equity. (The tilt toward smaller banks made them the
most attractive as investments in our opinion.)
4 Perpetual noncumulative preferred stock means that the stock does not have a designated redemption timeframe.
It lasts, in theory, in perpetuity. Noncumulative means any missed dividends do not have to be recouped. They are
just skipped. Preferred stock is part of equity, thus counting in terms of Tier 1 capital ratios. Preferred stock
dividend payments are not deductible to the bank.
The dividend rate is zero for the first two years. After year two it will vary based on how much the bank increases
its qualified lending to low- and middle-income borrowers. Between year three and ten, if lending increases less
than 200% of baseline pre-COVID lending amount (i.e., 2019 levels) the dividend rate will be 2%. If qualified
lending increases between 200% and 400%, the rate will be 1.25%. If it increases greater than 400% it will be
0.5%. After year 10 the rate is fixed based on average annual lending increase in years 2 through 10 (see 8/11/2021
Senior Preferred Term Sheet at https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-small-
businesses/emergency-capital-investment-program).

adopting this model. Hopefully other ECIP banks are paying attention and will follow
BankFirst’s lead. If not, BankFirst may soon be offering to buy them.)
M&F Bancorp (MFBP) is a North Carolina based bank that has run rate earnings as of the
second quarter of $1.85 per share. As we write this the stock is $17.50. There are less
than two million shares outstanding. M&F received $80 million of additional capital. Thus,
even today, a buyer is paying under ten times earnings for a bank with the potential to see
earnings potential triple if it acquires a bank earning $7 million after merger synergies, or
roughly $6 million currently. That is not only very possible, but probable assuming the
bank understands what it has in ECIP. There are even more tail winds for M&F that we
mention below that will also help propel earnings upward. The fund started buying in June
at under $9 per share.
Citizens Bancshares (CZBS) is an Atlanta, Georgia based bank with similar
characteristics. Its shares have jumped a bit due to the write up on twitter I mentioned
above. Citizens has roughly 2 million shares outstanding. Shares traded last at $23 per
share. Citizens received $95.7 million of additional capital. Citizens does not report
quarterly earnings, but the bank and the parent both file quarterly Call Reports. Both are
available on otcmarkets.com. Earnings for the first half of 2022 were about $1.60 per
share, but that is inflated due to a $1.8 million grant. Q2 EPS excluding the grant were
roughly $0.55 per share. Thus, Citizens is also trading at around ten times its earnings run
rate. Citizens has additional tailwinds beyond ECIP. The fund started buying in June at
$12 per share.
In order to be successful a bank needs access to capital, low cost deposits, lending and
investment opportunities, and usually some form of additional non-interest fee or trust
income. ECIP solved the problem of lack of capital.
Amazingly enough, ECIP funds are not the only capital funds some of the CDFI’s have
received. Citizens (CZBS) and M&F Bancorp (MFBP) both received preferred stock
investments from money center banks in 2021. Citizens issued $22 million of Preferred
Stock in 2021 with just a 1% dividend to major money center banks. M&F issued a total of
$17.5 million in Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock to JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells
Fargo and Citibank, and also issued 39,600 common shares. The preferred has a low 1%
rate; however, it does have a dividend share that gives the preferred a proportionate share
in dividend increases. Bank of America has also purchased 5% common equity positions in
ten MDI’s and CDFI’s (link). Most are privately held, but the list includes M&F Bancorp
(MFBP).
Post George Floyd, a number of large corporations announced their intentions to advance
racial equality by supporting MDI’s and CDFI’s by putting deposits at those banks. The
problem became the bank’s ability to have large deposits from just one customer.
JPMorgan created the JP Morgan Empower fund to address that issue. It is an institutional
money market fund where 12.5% of the management fee revenue received is directed to
specified CDFI’s and MDI’s. The minimum investment is $50 million. Both Citizens and
M&F receive funds from this program. If you look at M&F’s income statement under
noninterest income you will see a line titled “Commissions from sales of financial products.”
This is funds from this program directed to M&F. In Q1 it was $122,000. In Q2 it rose to
$231,000. If the trend continues, the Q3 number should be between $300,000 and
$350,000. Due to rising interest rates, we would not be surprised if Q4 income approaches
$500,000, which would mean a pre-tax run rate of $1 per share from this program alone
versus nothing in 2021. Hopefully we are not being too optimistic.
As the banks get larger, they will be able to take on larger deposits on their own balance
sheets which will allow them to earn multiples of what they currently receive from the

JPMorgan program. It is a virtuous cycle – as the banks grow larger, they can take on
larger deposits, which allows them to grow larger, etc.
The money center banks have also created a program to allow participation by select CDFI’s
in loan syndications. There is also the recently formed National Black Bank Foundation,
which recently organized a syndication team to structure a deal for the Atlanta Hawks
practice facility and complex. Citizens and M&F both participated in the loan.
A number of money center banks have also agreed to provide ATM access free of charge to
customers at M&F and Citizens. This will allow them to attract deposits outside of their
local branch base, as well as lower fees for existing customers who travel. We can envision
people intentionally choosing to bank with a CDFI or MDI, which would further grow
deposits. In a branchless banking world, why not support a CDFI instead of a large money
center bank?
Lastly, a number of government programs provide grant income. As we noted above,
Citizens received $1.8 million through CDFI Rapid Resource Grant program as well as $5
million from Morgan Stanley in 2020. Even with ECIP funds, we expect the government
programs, including the grant programs, to continue.
In summary, M&F Bancorp and Citizens Bancshares have obtained:
1. Significant funds via ECIP
2. Preferred stock investments by Money Center Banks
3. Substantial ESG investments (deposits, JP Morgan Empower fund)
4. Participation in Loan syndication with money center banks and National Black Bank
Foundation
5. ATM access nationwide with no fees
6. Government and private grants
Valuation
How should we value the ECIP funding? What is it worth to the banks? We are more
income statement focused; therefore, we look at what it could do to earnings and then
apply a fair multiple to those earnings. One way is to apply historical return on equity to the
ECIP funds less expected dividend rate of 0.5 -2.0%. This requires estimating current
earnings run rate and future return on equity once ECIP fully put into use, which should
exceed historical return on equity since certain overhead is already covered.

ECIP amount in millions.

The result is the smaller the bank the better with the proviso that they are already decently
profitable. Periodic grant income makes estimating profitability difficult for many of the
banks, and Harbor in particular. Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), United
Bancorporation of Alabama (UBAB), BankFirst (BFCC) and Community Bank of the Bay
(CBOBA) stand out the most. Assuming a 10-12x price to earnings ratio would result in a 2
-3x return for those five banks. When we first started buying M&F and Citizens their future
P/E was under two times using this approach, which meant we were expecting a 5-6x
return within three or four years. Since both have nearly doubled in price, future expected
return is no 2-3x over four years. We would stress that the timeframe assumes organic
growth. An acquisition can bring the increased earnings almost immediately. Thus, we
have a base case of 2-3x in four years, with an upside scenario of 2-3x in one year.
Another valuation approach is the balance sheet. The balance sheet investor is typically
looking at community banks that sell at a discount to tangible book value. Preferred stock
doesn’t impact that; however, since this preferred is potentially redeemable by the bank, it
could become common equity in a few years. The Treasury has implemented a number of
rules and already provided guidance on a minimum repurchase price. Without permission,
only another MDI or CDFI can buy a CDFI and rollover the preferred. What is interesting is
that the Treasury has said it may sell the preferred down the road, and when it does the
bank will have the opportunity to match an offer. The price will not be below 10% of face
value. Yes, you read that right. Treasury already recognizes that the fair value of the
preferred is a fraction of face value. A simple discounted cash flow comparing the preferred
to the market price of bank preferred with a hypothetical 7.5% yield will result in a fair
value of 10-25% of face value, thus the bank (i.e. common shareholder) is essentially being
gifted 75-90% of the face value of the preferred. The balance sheet investor could add that
amount to tangible book to get a ballpark estimate of fair value.

Market Cap, book value, and ECIP Approval amount in millions.
Using this metric, the five most attractive are Harbor (HRBR), Broadway Financial (BYFC),
Citizens (CZBS), M&F Bancorp (MFBP), and Merchants & Marine (MNMB). We have not
spent equivalent amounts of time on each of these banks. We have primarily focused on
M&F and Citizens. There may be benefits in some of the others we are not aware of, as
well as risks. Our rough estimate of their earnings may not be accurate.
With any investment there is risk. Buying banks in a rising interest rate environment is
typically not ideal. While we do have the additional capital protection courtesy of the ECIP
funds, there are still a number of risks, including:
1. rates paid on deposits approach or exceed rates paid on historical loans

2. mark to market on securities portfolios results in significant decreases to tangible book
value
3. increase in troubled loans, particularly since many borrowers have moderate incomes.
4. poor capital allocation
Another reason we like M&F Bancorp and Citizens is they have relatively small securities
portfolios that have to be marked to market and large cash and deposits at other banks.
Citizens had $360 million in cash and deposits versus its $832 million of assets. A
ridiculous 43% of assets. That is a lot of capital that can be deployed at higher rates,
whether 4% Treasury bills or 7% mortgages. M&F Bancorp had $135 million in cash versus
$450 million in assets. While still an attractive amount, it is 1/3 less percentage wise than
what Citizens had.
Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds
We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for
existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider
referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are
1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high
net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

The Western coast of Sicily has long been an important base for marine
activities, ranging from fisheries, ports, and shipbuilding, all the way to leisurely,
beachside enjoyment of the crystalline Mediterranean.
All these inhabitants will soon enjoy better data connectivity thanks to a subsea
cable being built by portfolio company Unidata S.p.A connecting Mazara del
Vallo to Genoa on the mainland. As the cable runs north through the Tyrrhenian

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund declined 2.2% in the third quarter, in line with comparable indexes. The fund remains
well ahead of its benchmarks this year and has outpaced these benchmarks by 7% annually net
of fees since inception in 2017. The economic performance of our portfolio remains robust with
nearly every holding continuing to report strong profits and cash flows. However, mounting fears
over recession, inflation, an energy crisis, and even the possibility of nuclear war have investors
in the doldrums. The market mood is simply miserable and in a miserable market, nobody cares
about any of the good news your companies may report. The best you can hope for is to tread
water. (And pity any of your holdings that reports bad news in a time like this. Look out below!)
This isn’t my first time investing in a miserable market. I don’t know when sentiment will change—
maybe later this year, maybe next year, maybe 2025—but it will change. Since nobody will do
us the courtesy of shouting “All clear!” when the market has bottomed, the best approach is, as
always, to go on accumulating good quality securities at large discounts to intrinsic value.

ECIP Banks
Alluvial Fund has an important new investment in a group of community banks. Thanks to a new
Treasury Department program, numerous small financial institutions have received a generous
infusion of low-cost permanent capital. This program will result in an incredible increase in profits
for several of the recipients, but the market has not yet adequately priced in this game-changing
development.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

Imagine you are the CEO of a bank. Your bank, let’s call it “First Citizens Fidelity Savings Bank,” is
a small institution with total assets of $900 million and shareholder capital of $100 million. FCFSB
operates in an area where many of the residents are lower-income and have long struggled to join
the middle class, and you are proud of the ways in which you have helped them achieve stronger
financial standing. You are also proud of the healthy returns you have provided your shareholders
through careful lending, measured growth, and keeping operating costs in check.
One afternoon you get a call from a nice staffer at the Department of the Treasury.
“Hello Mr./Ms. CEO! I wanted to tell you about a new program the Department is
rolling out to support banks like yours and invite you to apply. We’ve noticed how
active your bank is in lending to the local community. This program will support your
efforts with low-cost permanent capital.”
“You have my attention. Go on, what are the details?”
“We would like to purchase preferred stock from you. The terms are very fair. The
preferred stock will be perpetual and non-cumulative. There will be no dividend due
for the first two years. After that, you pay a maximum of 2%. Maybe lower, depending
on your ability to increase lending to disadvantaged communities. “
“Sounds too good to be true. What’s the catch?”
“No catch! There are some reasonable restrictions on executive compensation, return
of capital to shareholders, and mergers and acquisitions, but nothing punitive. An
institution like yours is unlikely to have any issues complying.”
“I’ll have to run it past the board, but everything I’ve heard so far is wonderful. How
much preferred stock can we issue the Treasury? $1 million? Maybe $2 million?”
“How does $110 million sound?”
After picking your jaw up from the floor and asking the Treasury representative to repeat the figure
a few times, your mind might begin to race. The Treasury would really double your bank’s equity
capital, and all this new equity would cost the bank a maximum of 2% per year, forever? Imagine
the possibilities! You could double the size of FCFSB’s balance sheet. Profits would skyrocket! Why,
even just parking $110 million in short-term treasuries would net you millions.
This conversation is purely imagined, but the scenario is real. Thanks to the Emergency Capital
Investment Program, many banks, thrifts, and mutuals have received extremely low-cost permanent
capital. Anyone interested in delving into the details of the program can check out the Treasury’s
extensive publications here. Suffice to say, the banks that have received this dirt-cheap funding
have it made. With just moderate balance sheet expansion, their profits should increase 100-200%
over the next few years. Several ECIP recipients are trading at low single digit multiples of 2024-ish
earnings.
Of course, most of these banks will not achieve this kind of profit growth. Only some of the ECIP
recipients are high quality institutions. Many have issues with loan quality or are too sub-scale to
earn a competitive return on equity even post-ECIP. There’s an argument to be made for holding
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

one’s nose and investing in the banks that received the largest capital infusion relative to their
prior market capitalization or shareholder capital, but I believe we can generate more certain
and lower-risk returns by focusing on the stronger institutions. I don’t believe these ECIP funds
will change the character of the banks receiving them. Banks making good loans and looking out
for shareholders now have much greater ability to do so. However, banks with sloppy operations
making bad loans can now make twice as many or more. That’s rarely a good thing.
Alluvial Fund is invested in three ECIP program banks. BankFirst Capital Corporation is a $2
billion Mississippi bank holding company that received $175 million from the ECIP. Already,
BankFirst has acquired one bank and is working to acquire another, fellow ECIP recipient
Mechanics Bank, which received $44 million.
I fully expect BankFirst to acquire additional

received $123 million. Just before the P10 Inc. 11.5

of Alabama repurchased 5% of shares
outstanding. I expect the company to ECIP Bank Basket 6.7

P10 Builds
Alluvial’s largest holding remains P10 Inc., Total, Top Ten 58.7%
owner of a diversified set of alternative assets
managers. Second quarter earnings were strong and saw continued organic growth in assets under
management. Shortly following the earnings report, P10 announced an acquisition that will grow
assets under management and be accretive to free cash flow per share, in a deal that closed just
days ago in mid-October.
P10 has purchased Western Technology Investment, a manager of venture debt funds. Founded
in 1980, WTI has provided nearly $8 billion in debt commitments to venture companies largely in
the technology and life sciences sectors. Building on this track record, WTI is expected to launch a
new fund in 2024. P10 purchased Western Technology Investment for $97 million in cash plus the
equivalent of $40 million in P10 stock, representing a multiple of 11x WTI’s pre-tax cash flow. The
deal also includes an earn-out provision if WTI’s earnings achieve certain thresholds.
This transaction will benefit P10 by growing fee-paying assets under management to at least
$19.9 billion, as well as increasing both the average fee rate on and average duration of assets
under management, resulting in annualized revenues climbing to $200 million. Given these
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

improvements, adjusted for the additional debt and higher interest rates, I now estimate P10’s
annualized free cash flow at 84 cents per share. If WTI hits the high end of its earn-out range, that
free cash flow would increase to 91 cents per share. Currently priced around $10.30, P10 shares
change hands for just 12.3x forward-looking free cash flow, less if the WTI investment works out
well. Increases in AUM from P10’s existing strategies will further depress that multiple.
Meanwhile, P10 shares are just plain depressed.
It’s not hard to see why. The economic picture is rocky. There are concerns about the ability of
alternatives managers to raise capital amidst jittery equity and debt markets. It may seem like
an inopportune environment in which to own a small, little-known alternatives manager. But
nothing about the P10 story has changed. The company still enjoys supremely predictable, high-
margin revenues looking out several years. Management is still as sharp as they come and well-
incentivized to grow the value of the company, not least because they own most of it. Free cash
flow per share will continue to grow and the market will come around in the end.
Unidata and the Value of Ambition
Despite the flow of negative headlines out of Europe, Alluvial’s second-largest holding, Unidata
SpA, is thriving. First-half results saw Unidata’s customer count rise 29% year-over-year and its
fiber network expand by 35% to 4,920 kilometers. EBITDA rose 53%. The company issued a €10
million bond to help finance the construction of a green data center in Rome. Most excitingly,
the company announced two large new initiatives: the doubling of the scope of its “Unifiber”
project installing fiber in unreached areas of Lazio, plus “Unitirreno,” a proposal to build an 890
kilometer submarine cable in the Tyrrhenian
Sea connecting Sicily and Genoa. In order
to finance this major expansion of Unidata’s TABLE III: World Allocation, 9/30/22 (%)
footprint, the company will seek to raise
United States 75.7
up to €50 million in equity capital and
Eurozone 13.1

of the Borsa Italiana in 2023. I expect the Poland 5.7

will help Unidata shares achieve a more

I love the ambition. I wish I could find
more small companies willing to undertake
measured risks in pursuit of transformational and extremely profitable growth. I’m not talking about
pie-in-the-sky, risk the company moonshots, but simply large investments representing meaningful
capital commitments with ample financial rationale. I see far too many small companies that are
more or less cast in amber. They look the same and act the same year in, year out. Some are
at least honest that they have no ideas and simply return profits to shareholders. Others hoard
cash flow or piddle it away on immaterial initiatives, hoping to juice profits 2-3% over the next
18 months or achieve some other inconsequential goal. The dishonest ones, of course, find ways
to divert shareholder wealth to insiders and related parties. Not good enough! Now, some large
companies have genuinely reached the limits of their markets and further expansion offers either
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

insufficient reward or could invite antitrust attention. But for a small company, there is always
something to do. Customers want additional products and services. Competitors and sometimes
suppliers and distributors can be acquired. New markets are always developing. It’s not that any
of these options is always a good idea to pursue, but often enough, at least one of them is. A
company that refuses to engage with the full slate of possibilities is failing its shareholders.
At the heart of the problem is incentives. Most small company management teams draw a nice
salary but own shares in amounts not meaningful to their overall wealth. In that case, why rock the
boat? Far better to hunker down, draw a comfortable salary and benefits and at all costs, protect
that easy money. Unidata could not be more different. Management owns 70% of the company.
They have built a profitable and dynamic operation and have enjoyed the rewards, becoming very
wealthy in the process. But they see an opportunity in front of them to double or triple the value of
Unidata shares, and they’re going after it.
Other Holdings and Updates
Other Alluvial Fund holdings have reported meaningful developments and updates. The most
significant is Harbor Diversified, whose Air Wisconsin subsidiary reported a new contract to
operate the majority of its fleet for American Airlines. Details of the new contract are not yet
available, but the market continues to value Harbor Diversified as if the new contract has negative
economic value. Despite the good news, shares continue to trade at a sharp discount to Harbor’s
existing assets and remaining earnings from its contract with United. I expect this discount to
narrow as we receive more clarity around the company’s new contract with American and plans for
its substantial cash and securities holdings.
Garrett Motion has elected to begin paying cash dividends on its convertible preferred shares.
Doing so prevents dividends in arrears from further accruing and is a wise use of the company’s
free cash flow. I believe the choice to initiate a cash dividend is a tacit admission by the company
that the necessary conditions for converting the preferred shares will not be met soon. This is a
mild short-term negative, as the complex capital structure will remain in place for now. On the
other hand, I am thrilled for us to earn a 9% yield as the company uses its free cash flow to buy
back cheap stock and wait for the automotive cycle to turn.
GEE Group reported outstanding quarterly earnings, but shares remain exceptionally cheap. At
a market capitalization of $75 million, the company trades at just 5x normalized cash earnings
and has 22% of its market capitalization in cash. While GEE Group shares have been winners for
the fund, they continue to trade at stubbornly low valuations. Perhaps investors are anticipating a
cooling labor market, but it would take a deep retrenchment in hiring trends for GEE Group shares
to be anything except an incredible bargain at today’s prices.
Unless we experience a dramatic rally to close out the year, 2022 is shaping up to be one that
investors will not remember with much fondness. I am pleased that our collection of cash-flowing,
well-financed companies has held up better than markets in general, but I look forward to a time
when the market looks on our portfolio with a more favorable eye. Until then, I will continue

The Western coast of Sicily has long been an important base for marine
activities, ranging from fisheries, ports, and shipbuilding, all the way to leisurely,
beachside enjoyment of the crystalline Mediterranean.
All these inhabitants will soon enjoy better data connectivity thanks to a subsea
cable being built by portfolio company Unidata S.p.A connecting Mazara del
Vallo to Genoa on the mainland. As the cable runs north through the Tyrrhenian
Sea towards Liguria, it will also branch east towards Rome and the new green
data center being built by Unidata in the capital city.
More information about the developments at Unidata can be found in this
quarter’s letter.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund declined 2.2% in the third quarter, in line with comparable indexes. The fund remains
well ahead of its benchmarks this year and has outpaced these benchmarks by 7% annually net
of fees since inception in 2017. The economic performance of our portfolio remains robust with
nearly every holding continuing to report strong profits and cash flows. However, mounting fears
over recession, inflation, an energy crisis, and even the possibility of nuclear war have investors
in the doldrums. The market mood is simply miserable and in a miserable market, nobody cares
about any of the good news your companies may report. The best you can hope for is to tread
water. (And pity any of your holdings that reports bad news in a time like this. Look out below!)
This isn’t my first time investing in a miserable market. I don’t know when sentiment will change—
maybe later this year, maybe next year, maybe 2025—but it will change. Since nobody will do
us the courtesy of shouting “All clear!” when the market has bottomed, the best approach is, as
always, to go on accumulating good quality securities at large discounts to intrinsic value.

ECIP Banks
Alluvial Fund has an important new investment in a group of community banks. Thanks to a new
Treasury Department program, numerous small financial institutions have received a generous
infusion of low-cost permanent capital. This program will result in an incredible increase in profits
for several of the recipients, but the market has not yet adequately priced in this game-changing
development.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

Imagine you are the CEO of a bank. Your bank, let’s call it “First Citizens Fidelity Savings Bank,” is
a small institution with total assets of $900 million and shareholder capital of $100 million. FCFSB
operates in an area where many of the residents are lower-income and have long struggled to join
the middle class, and you are proud of the ways in which you have helped them achieve stronger
financial standing. You are also proud of the healthy returns you have provided your shareholders
through careful lending, measured growth, and keeping operating costs in check.
One afternoon you get a call from a nice staffer at the Department of the Treasury.
“Hello Mr./Ms. CEO! I wanted to tell you about a new program the Department is
rolling out to support banks like yours and invite you to apply. We’ve noticed how
active your bank is in lending to the local community. This program will support your
efforts with low-cost permanent capital.”
“You have my attention. Go on, what are the details?”
“We would like to purchase preferred stock from you. The terms are very fair. The
preferred stock will be perpetual and non-cumulative. There will be no dividend due
for the first two years. After that, you pay a maximum of 2%. Maybe lower, depending
on your ability to increase lending to disadvantaged communities. “
“Sounds too good to be true. What’s the catch?”
“No catch! There are some reasonable restrictions on executive compensation, return
of capital to shareholders, and mergers and acquisitions, but nothing punitive. An
institution like yours is unlikely to have any issues complying.”
“I’ll have to run it past the board, but everything I’ve heard so far is wonderful. How
much preferred stock can we issue the Treasury? $1 million? Maybe $2 million?”
“How does $110 million sound?”
After picking your jaw up from the floor and asking the Treasury representative to repeat the figure
a few times, your mind might begin to race. The Treasury would really double your bank’s equity
capital, and all this new equity would cost the bank a maximum of 2% per year, forever? Imagine
the possibilities! You could double the size of FCFSB’s balance sheet. Profits would skyrocket! Why,
even just parking $110 million in short-term treasuries would net you millions.
This conversation is purely imagined, but the scenario is real. Thanks to the Emergency Capital
Investment Program, many banks, thrifts, and mutuals have received extremely low-cost permanent
capital. Anyone interested in delving into the details of the program can check out the Treasury’s
extensive publications here. Suffice to say, the banks that have received this dirt-cheap funding
have it made. With just moderate balance sheet expansion, their profits should increase 100-200%
over the next few years. Several ECIP recipients are trading at low single digit multiples of 2024-ish
earnings.
Of course, most of these banks will not achieve this kind of profit growth. Only some of the ECIP
recipients are high quality institutions. Many have issues with loan quality or are too sub-scale to
earn a competitive return on equity even post-ECIP. There’s an argument to be made for holding
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

one’s nose and investing in the banks that received the largest capital infusion relative to their
prior market capitalization or shareholder capital, but I believe we can generate more certain
and lower-risk returns by focusing on the stronger institutions. I don’t believe these ECIP funds
will change the character of the banks receiving them. Banks making good loans and looking out
for shareholders now have much greater ability to do so. However, banks with sloppy operations
making bad loans can now make twice as many or more. That’s rarely a good thing.
Alluvial Fund is invested in three ECIP program banks. BankFirst Capital Corporation is a $2
billion Mississippi bank holding company that received $175 million from the ECIP. Already,
BankFirst has acquired one bank and is working to acquire another, fellow ECIP recipient
Mechanics Bank, which received $44 million.
I fully expect BankFirst to acquire additional
TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 9/30/22 (%)
banks. United Bancorporation of Alabama
received $123 million. Just before the P10 Inc. 11.5
ECIP investment, United Bancorporation
Unidata S.p.A. 8.8
of Alabama repurchased 5% of shares
outstanding. I expect the company to ECIP Bank Basket 6.7
continue returning capital in proportion with
Rand Worldwide Inc. 6.0
its ECIP-driven earnings growth. Finally, Bay
Community Bancorp’s Community Bank of GEE Group Inc. 5.5
the Bay received $119 million, equal to nearly
Garrett Motion Inc. 4.3
180% of the bancorp’s June 30 shareholder
equity—a stunning multiple. The California LICT Corporation 4.2
bank also got in the act of returning capital,
Harbor Diversified Inc. 4.1
repurchasing 3.2% of shares outstanding in
August. Butler National Corp. 3.9
Undisclosed Packaged Foods Co. 3.7
P10 Builds
Alluvial’s largest holding remains P10 Inc., Total, Top Ten 58.7%
owner of a diversified set of alternative assets
managers. Second quarter earnings were strong and saw continued organic growth in assets under
management. Shortly following the earnings report, P10 announced an acquisition that will grow
assets under management and be accretive to free cash flow per share, in a deal that closed just
days ago in mid-October.
P10 has purchased Western Technology Investment, a manager of venture debt funds. Founded
in 1980, WTI has provided nearly $8 billion in debt commitments to venture companies largely in
the technology and life sciences sectors. Building on this track record, WTI is expected to launch a
new fund in 2024. P10 purchased Western Technology Investment for $97 million in cash plus the
equivalent of $40 million in P10 stock, representing a multiple of 11x WTI’s pre-tax cash flow. The
deal also includes an earn-out provision if WTI’s earnings achieve certain thresholds.
This transaction will benefit P10 by growing fee-paying assets under management to at least
$19.9 billion, as well as increasing both the average fee rate on and average duration of assets
under management, resulting in annualized revenues climbing to $200 million. Given these
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

improvements, adjusted for the additional debt and higher interest rates, I now estimate P10’s
annualized free cash flow at 84 cents per share. If WTI hits the high end of its earn-out range, that
free cash flow would increase to 91 cents per share. Currently priced around $10.30, P10 shares
change hands for just 12.3x forward-looking free cash flow, less if the WTI investment works out
well. Increases in AUM from P10’s existing strategies will further depress that multiple.
Meanwhile, P10 shares are just plain depressed.
It’s not hard to see why. The economic picture is rocky. There are concerns about the ability of
alternatives managers to raise capital amidst jittery equity and debt markets. It may seem like
an inopportune environment in which to own a small, little-known alternatives manager. But
nothing about the P10 story has changed. The company still enjoys supremely predictable, high-
margin revenues looking out several years. Management is still as sharp as they come and well-
incentivized to grow the value of the company, not least because they own most of it. Free cash
flow per share will continue to grow and the market will come around in the end.
Unidata and the Value of Ambition
Despite the flow of negative headlines out of Europe, Alluvial’s second-largest holding, Unidata
SpA, is thriving. First-half results saw Unidata’s customer count rise 29% year-over-year and its
fiber network expand by 35% to 4,920 kilometers. EBITDA rose 53%. The company issued a €10
million bond to help finance the construction of a green data center in Rome. Most excitingly,
the company announced two large new initiatives: the doubling of the scope of its “Unifiber”
project installing fiber in unreached areas of Lazio, plus “Unitirreno,” a proposal to build an 890
kilometer submarine cable in the Tyrrhenian
Sea connecting Sicily and Genoa. In order
to finance this major expansion of Unidata’s TABLE III: World Allocation, 9/30/22 (%)
footprint, the company will seek to raise
United States 75.7
up to €50 million in equity capital and
Eurozone 13.1
simultaneously uplist to the STAR segment
of the Borsa Italiana in 2023. I expect the Poland 5.7
improved trading liquidity and higher profile
Sweden 3.9
will help Unidata shares achieve a more
reasonable valuation. Other 1.6
Total 100%
I love the ambition. I wish I could find
more small companies willing to undertake
measured risks in pursuit of transformational and extremely profitable growth. I’m not talking about
pie-in-the-sky, risk the company moonshots, but simply large investments representing meaningful
capital commitments with ample financial rationale. I see far too many small companies that are
more or less cast in amber. They look the same and act the same year in, year out. Some are
at least honest that they have no ideas and simply return profits to shareholders. Others hoard
cash flow or piddle it away on immaterial initiatives, hoping to juice profits 2-3% over the next
18 months or achieve some other inconsequential goal. The dishonest ones, of course, find ways
to divert shareholder wealth to insiders and related parties. Not good enough! Now, some large
companies have genuinely reached the limits of their markets and further expansion offers either
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

insufficient reward or could invite antitrust attention. But for a small company, there is always
something to do. Customers want additional products and services. Competitors and sometimes
suppliers and distributors can be acquired. New markets are always developing. It’s not that any
of these options is always a good idea to pursue, but often enough, at least one of them is. A
company that refuses to engage with the full slate of possibilities is failing its shareholders.
At the heart of the problem is incentives. Most small company management teams draw a nice
salary but own shares in amounts not meaningful to their overall wealth. In that case, why rock the
boat? Far better to hunker down, draw a comfortable salary and benefits and at all costs, protect
that easy money. Unidata could not be more different. Management owns 70% of the company.
They have built a profitable and dynamic operation and have enjoyed the rewards, becoming very
wealthy in the process. But they see an opportunity in front of them to double or triple the value of
Unidata shares, and they’re going after it.
Other Holdings and Updates
Other Alluvial Fund holdings have reported meaningful developments and updates. The most
significant is Harbor Diversified, whose Air Wisconsin subsidiary reported a new contract to
operate the majority of its fleet for American Airlines. Details of the new contract are not yet
available, but the market continues to value Harbor Diversified as if the new contract has negative
economic value. Despite the good news, shares continue to trade at a sharp discount to Harbor’s
existing assets and remaining earnings from its contract with United. I expect this discount to
narrow as we receive more clarity around the company’s new contract with American and plans for
its substantial cash and securities holdings.
Garrett Motion has elected to begin paying cash dividends on its convertible preferred shares.
Doing so prevents dividends in arrears from further accruing and is a wise use of the company’s
free cash flow. I believe the choice to initiate a cash dividend is a tacit admission by the company
that the necessary conditions for converting the preferred shares will not be met soon. This is a
mild short-term negative, as the complex capital structure will remain in place for now. On the
other hand, I am thrilled for us to earn a 9% yield as the company uses its free cash flow to buy
back cheap stock and wait for the automotive cycle to turn.
GEE Group reported outstanding quarterly earnings, but shares remain exceptionally cheap. At
a market capitalization of $75 million, the company trades at just 5x normalized cash earnings
and has 22% of its market capitalization in cash. While GEE Group shares have been winners for
the fund, they continue to trade at stubbornly low valuations. Perhaps investors are anticipating a
cooling labor market, but it would take a deep retrenchment in hiring trends for GEE Group shares
to be anything except an incredible bargain at today’s prices.
Unless we experience a dramatic rally to close out the year, 2022 is shaping up to be one that
investors will not remember with much fondness. I am pleased that our collection of cash-flowing,
well-financed companies has held up better than markets in general, but I look forward to a time
when the market looks on our portfolio with a more favorable eye. Until then, I will continue
scouring markets for opportunities to complement our existing set. I find it best to think of bear
markets the way I think of inclement weather (a phenomenon I am all too familiar with as a life-long
Western Pennsylvanian). Dreary clouds full of cold rain may linger for a good while, but they always
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q3 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

move on. Alluvial will go on purchasing good securities at deep discounts to intrinsic value and the
weather will take care of itself.

Third Point Offshore Fund,Daniel S. Loeb,"October 16, 2024",2024.0,3.0,3.9,,,,"The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure. Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices.

Please note there is a one-month lag in performance reflected for the CS HF Event-Driven Index 2 Annualized Return from inception (December 1996 for TP Offshore and quoted indices). PLEASE SEE THE NEW SERIES RETURNS AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT. The top five winners for the quarter were a private position in R2 Semiconductor, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Vistra Corp., KB Home, and Danaher Corp. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding hedges, were Bath & Body Works Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. REVIEW AND OUTLOOK1 During the Third Quarter, Third Point Offshore generated gains of nearly 4%, bringing year- to-date returns to 14%, net of fees and expenses. Global equity markets continued their strong performance, but returns were driven by substantially more market breadth than over the previous year and a half. The “Magnificent Seven” trailed the broader market (albeit modestly) for the first time since Q4 2022. Rate sensitive stocks and cyclicals significantly outperformed as the market shifted its focus to the Fed’s long-awaited easing cycle. As we highlighted in our Second Quarter letter, our portfolio has a broad range of investment themes outside of large cap tech. These types of investments in industrials, utilities, materials, and other housing-sensitive stocks led the portfolio for Q3. For most of the nearly thirty years I have run Third Point, the market has been inexorably climbing a wall of worry. At times, the worry turns to despair, most recently in the beginning of August, when the Nikkei inexplicably tanked roughly 20% in a few days and volatility in the US exploded to nearly 70 from 16, all while US markets dropped 6%. Many pundits saw this as a warning that the market had more room to drop and that, in the best case, stocks had become “un-investable” through the election. While we took our lumps for a few days, we stayed committed to our positions, took the view that the market rotation would continue, and increased our investments in event-driven and value-oriented stocks. Considering political developments over the past few weeks, we believe that the likelihood of a Republican victory in the White House has increased, which would have a positive impact on certain sectors and the market overall. We believe the proposed “America First” policy’s tariffs will increase domestic manufacturing, infrastructure spending, and prices of certain materials and commodities. We also believe that a reduction in regulation generally and especially in the activist antitrust stance of the Biden-Harris administration will unleash productivity and a wave of corporate activity. Accordingly, we have increased certain positions that could benefit from such a scenario via both stock and option purchases and continue to shift our portfolio away from companies that will not. Whatever the outcome of the Presidential election, we have carefully studied the Senate races and believe that the Republicans will establish a majority, limiting the economic downside of a “Blue Sweep” which could theoretically usher in crushing taxes, stifling regulations, and a headwind to growth. In the economy, we see no evidence of recession, slowing inflation, and a real interest rate that still needs to come down. We believe healthy consumer spending and active levels of individual investing should provide a liquidity backdrop to sustain market levels. We think this setup is a particularly good one for event-driven investing, particularly since most of our competitors in this area have retired or moved on. The potential for risk arbitrage transactions and corporate activity could usher in a golden age for the strategy. At this point, our gross exposures are low, we have modest nets, are well positioned in our current portfolio, and can deploy fresh capital as opportunities arise. Equity Updates DSV During the Third Quarter, we initiated a new position in the Danish freight forwarder DSV. DSV has come a long way from its origins as a Nordic road-hauler to become the world’s third largest freight forwarder, with a formidable track record of consolidating the fragmented global freight forwarding industry. We believe the company has an impressive culture that is systems-driven and returns-focused. DSV has generated an approximately 20% EPS CAGR over the past 10 years and is widely recognized as the best-in-class operator, with industry- leading growth and profit margins. DSV emerged as the leading bidder in the auction of DB Schenker, a subsidiary of German state-owned Deutsche Bahn AG, and one of its largest competitors. DB Schenker is similar in size to DSV but only half as profitable. We believe the integration and synergy capture expected from this combination will follow a proven playbook and drive earnings accretion in excess of 30%. We have analyzed DSV’s many acquisitions and observed that they follow a pattern of swiftly migrating the target onto DSV’s IT system, culling low-margin business, and rightsizing the cost structure, resulting in the target’s margins reaching DSV’s best-in- class margins within two years. The DB Schenker acquisition is taking place at an interesting time. Following a period of post-COVID earnings normalization and a CEO change, DSV’s stock was trading at an approximate 20% discount to both its lower-growth peers and its historical multiple. Following the deal, DSV will be the largest player in an industry in which scale brings tangible cost and network benefits. An example of this privileged competitive positioning is that DSV was selected as the exclusive logistics provider for Saudi Arabia’s NEOM project. We believe the joint venture between DSV and Saudi Arabia will provide end-to-end supply chain management, develop transport and logistic assets, and grow the company’s earnings power by about 15% by 2028. We have spent time with Jens Lund, DSV’s long time COO/CFO who became CEO earlier this year and have found him to be laser-focused on creating shareholder value. Mr. Lund made a compelling case that rising complexity in global supply chains will benefit DSV, as it monetizes its unique network that guarantees capacity and on-time deliveries. In the freight forwarding industry, simple load, A-to-B transportation is barely profitable. The real money is made from value-added services such as customs clearance, load consolidation and intervention when problems occur, a core competency of DSV. We believe DSV can earn more than 100 DKK per share in 2027 and see significant upside for one of Europe’s best companies. Cinemark Earlier this year we took a stake in Cinemark, the third largest movie theater chain in the U.S. We believe Cinemark is poised for underappreciated growth over the next few years as the supply of theatrical releases rebounds from pandemic- and strike-related headwinds. In addition, we believe Cinemark will gain share from undercapitalized competitors. There is no shortage of skeptics about the move theater business. In 2020 the outlook for domestic cinemas looked bleak: the rapid rise of streaming, combined with behavior changes from the pandemic, cast doubt on whether people would ever go to theaters again. Regal Cinemas filed for bankruptcy. AMC became a meme stock. Against this inauspicious backdrop, Cinemark has demonstrated resilient financial performance. Consider that in 2023, counterintuitively, Cinemark reported higher free cash flow than they did in the two years prior to the pandemic. Yet, Cinemark stock entered 2024 trading 70% below pre-pandemic levels (a mid-single digit multiple on trailing 12-month free cash flow), suggesting market participants feared free cash flow would drop precipitously and never recover. We disagree with this view and believe the multi-year outlook for Cinemark has never been more robust. Despite the recent success of films such as “Inside Out 2”, 2024 industry revenues are expected to finish at approximately $8.5 billion, over 20% below pre-pandemic levels. While many in the market attribute this to changing consumer preferences, the data demonstrates theaters are a supply-driven industry (more films equal more foot traffic), and we believe the key driver of weak box office revenues has been a 20% decrease in widescreen theatrical releases since 2019. Importantly, we believe that this is driven by cyclical factors, namely labor stoppages from the pandemic and subsequently the strikes, rather than secular factors. Over the past three years, forays into exclusive streaming and day-and-date releases have proven too unprofitable, and the “event” aspect of a theatrical release has proven critical to securing top talent and creating franchise IP that can drive future earnings. As a result, all six major Hollywood studios have committed to ramp volume back up to pre-COVID levels, and even pureplay streamers like Amazon and Apple have begun releasing films exclusively in theaters. We expect supply to rebound next year and reach the pre-COVID level by 2026, which we expect to drive a full recovery in box office revenues as modestly lower per-film attendance is offset by price increases and growth in concession revenues. In our view, transient headwinds from the 2023 Hollywood strikes were masking this important secular shift in film supply, which gave us the opportunity to initiate the investment at a dislocated valuation. Cinemark's earnings outperformance versus its peers through the pandemic has not been an accident; while AMC and Regal have been closing screens and underinvesting to preserve liquidity, Cinemark used what we see as a strong balance sheet and relentless focus on cost efficiencies to sustain maintenance capex in their theaters despite the challenged operating backdrop. As a result, the company has taken over 100 bps of market share, a trend we see as sustainable as peers continue to rationalize their footprint despite an improving market. Given the significant recovery in box office, potential for continued share gain and high operating leverage of the business, we think Cinemark can generate over $4 of FCF/share in 2026, which is meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels and should grow in the following years. The company announced it will lay out its long-term capital allocation strategy in early 2025, including a re-introduction of a dividend, which should be supportive of a continued re-rating in the shares. Credit Updates Corporate Credit Third Point’s corporate credit book generated a 3.5% gross return (3.4% net) during the quarter, contributing 50 basis points to performance. That puts year-to-date performance at +8.3% gross (8.2% net), in line with the high yield index. The summer proved anything but cruel for high yield, with the market returning 5.3% during the quarter, in line with the strong performance of the S&P 500. Spreads tightened marginally with most of the return driven by the decline in interest rates. While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. First, Lumen Technologies (LUMN) announced that its Level 3 (LVLT) subsidiary was doing a fiber infrastructure build to support AI growth. Our aversion to secular decline (most of LUMN is melting copper infrastructure) kept us out of the situation but the AI fairy dust resulted in a massive rerating of LUMN debt and equity. These higher security prices in turn facilitated several moves to refinance portions of the capital structure and extend the runway. Second, Verizon (VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint. Much has been written about “creditor on creditor violence” – liability management deals where issuers are able to reduce their cost of capital or extend liquidity runways by offering a subset of creditors a chance to move up the capital stack at the expense of their brethren. These are frequently less than zero sum deals for creditors and primarily benefit financial sponsors, and a large number end up restructuring anyway after paying enormous fees to lawyers and advisors. As a result, we are seeing a rising number of creditor “co-op agreements”, which serve to prevent sponsors from manipulating creditors. While we have generally been very careful to position ourselves on the winning side of these skirmishes, we are pleased to see the rise of these co-op agreements. Co-ops can make investing in highly stressed situations more attractive because you can trust that a senior obligation does not get leapfrogged by a junior obligation. Additionally, it seems likely that these co-ops will accelerate the pace of restructurings, since sponsors will have limited options to buy time to avoid equity write-offs. While the high yield market has rallied, we have continued to find opportunity in a few areas. We have bought into several credits that have gone through liability management deals. These businesses were improving, and recapitalization was comprehensive enough to “fix” the balance sheet. We are also finding value in several loan-only structures that have lagged the rally in the high yield market. Structured Credit The Structured Credit portfolio contributed 20 basis points in the quarter, driven by Treasuries and credit spreads rallying. While the Treasury market has likely overestimated the magnitude of potential Fed rate cuts for this year, we took advantage of that market window and exercised our call rights on eight reperforming mortgage deals this quarter. We priced a new mortgage securitization in August with AAA’s pricing inside of 5%, closer to investment grade yields we saw in 2019 and early 2020. As insurance companies and private credits funds actively look for investment grade risk, we have been able to access, in our view, attractive cost of funds across structured credit loans. Given the decline in new mortgage originations and newly issued mortgage-backed securities, we have seen an improvement in the technical backdrop for existing securities and loans. We believe this dynamic gives us an advantage as we continue to sell and optimize our existing mortgage portfolio. On the ABS front, yields have continued to compress across all asset classes. Spreads have remained largely unchanged on our rental car ABS portfolio, which we bought earlier this year at double digit yields. This has been a positive trade for the portfolio as we realize significant carry each month. We have been monetizing our ABS positions into this credit spread tightening and are spending more time on CLOs and CMBS as credit events start to play out. As we face geopolitical uncertainty and a volatile interest rate environment, we anticipate interesting investment opportunities in the Fourth Quarter as investors look to protect a solid 2024 performance. Private Position Update: R2 Semiconductor In March, we disclosed that we were supporting R2 Semiconductor, a private company in our Third Point ventures portfolio that we invested in over 15 years earlier, as it sought to enforce its patented technology against Intel. The technology, developed by R2’s Founder David Fisher, relates to integrated voltage regulation, which plays an essential part in reducing power consumption by microchips while maintaining product reliability. At the end of August, Intel announced that its dispute with R2 had been fully settled in all jurisdictions. The terms are confidential, but we are pleased with the outcome, which resulted in a significant gain in the position for the quarter.

REVIEW AND OUTLOOK1
During the Third Quarter, Third Point Offshore generated gains of nearly 4%, bringing year-
to-date returns to 14%, net of fees and expenses. Global equity markets continued their

strong performance, but returns were driven by substantially more market breadth than
over the previous year and a half. The “Magnificent Seven” trailed the broader market (albeit
modestly) for the first time since Q4 2022. Rate sensitive stocks and cyclicals significantly
outperformed as the market shifted its focus to the Fed’s long-awaited easing cycle. As we
highlighted in our Second Quarter letter, our portfolio has a broad range of investment
themes outside of large cap tech. These types of investments in industrials, utilities,
materials, and other housing-sensitive stocks led the portfolio for Q3.
For most of the nearly thirty years I have run Third Point, the market has been inexorably
climbing a wall of worry. At times, the worry turns to despair, most recently in the beginning
of August, when the Nikkei inexplicably tanked roughly 20% in a few days and volatility in
the US exploded to nearly 70 from 16, all while US markets dropped 6%. Many pundits saw
this as a warning that the market had more room to drop and that, in the best case, stocks
had become “un-investable” through the election. While we took our lumps for a few days,
we stayed committed to our positions, took the view that the market rotation would
continue, and increased our investments in event-driven and value-oriented stocks.
Considering political developments over the past few weeks, we believe that the likelihood
of a Republican victory in the White House has increased, which would have a positive
impact on certain sectors and the market overall. We believe the proposed “America First”
policy’s tariffs will increase domestic manufacturing, infrastructure spending, and prices of
certain materials and commodities. We also believe that a reduction in regulation generally
and especially in the activist antitrust stance of the Biden-Harris administration will unleash
productivity and a wave of corporate activity. Accordingly, we have increased certain
positions that could benefit from such a scenario via both stock and option purchases and
continue to shift our portfolio away from companies that will not. Whatever the outcome of
the Presidential election, we have carefully studied the Senate races and believe that the
Republicans will establish a majority, limiting the economic downside of a “Blue Sweep”
which could theoretically usher in crushing taxes, stifling regulations, and a headwind to
growth.
Page 2

In the economy, we see no evidence of recession, slowing inflation, and a real interest rate
that still needs to come down. We believe healthy consumer spending and active levels of
individual investing should provide a liquidity backdrop to sustain market levels. We think
this setup is a particularly good one for event-driven investing, particularly since most of our
competitors in this area have retired or moved on. The potential for risk arbitrage
transactions and corporate activity could usher in a golden age for the strategy. At this point,
our gross exposures are low, we have modest nets, are well positioned in our current
portfolio, and can deploy fresh capital as opportunities arise.
Equity Updates
DSV
During the Third Quarter, we initiated a new position in the Danish freight forwarder DSV.
DSV has come a long way from its origins as a Nordic road-hauler to become the world’s third
largest freight forwarder, with a formidable track record of consolidating the fragmented
global freight forwarding industry. We believe the company has an impressive culture that
is systems-driven and returns-focused. DSV has generated an approximately 20% EPS CAGR
over the past 10 years and is widely recognized as the best-in-class operator, with industry-
leading growth and profit margins.
DSV emerged as the leading bidder in the auction of DB Schenker, a subsidiary of German
state-owned Deutsche Bahn AG, and one of its largest competitors. DB Schenker is similar in
size to DSV but only half as profitable. We believe the integration and synergy capture
expected from this combination will follow a proven playbook and drive earnings accretion
in excess of 30%. We have analyzed DSV’s many acquisitions and observed that they follow
a pattern of swiftly migrating the target onto DSV’s IT system, culling low-margin business,
and rightsizing the cost structure, resulting in the target’s margins reaching DSV’s best-in-
class margins within two years.
The DB Schenker acquisition is taking place at an interesting time. Following a period of
post-COVID earnings normalization and a CEO change, DSV’s stock was trading at an
Page 3

approximate 20% discount to both its lower-growth peers and its historical multiple.
Following the deal, DSV will be the largest player in an industry in which scale brings tangible
cost and network benefits. An example of this privileged competitive positioning is that DSV
was selected as the exclusive logistics provider for Saudi Arabia’s NEOM project. We believe
the joint venture between DSV and Saudi Arabia will provide end-to-end supply chain
management, develop transport and logistic assets, and grow the company’s earnings power
by about 15% by 2028.
We have spent time with Jens Lund, DSV’s long time COO/CFO who became CEO earlier this
year and have found him to be laser-focused on creating shareholder value. Mr. Lund made
a compelling case that rising complexity in global supply chains will benefit DSV, as it
monetizes its unique network that guarantees capacity and on-time deliveries. In the freight
forwarding industry, simple load, A-to-B transportation is barely profitable. The real money
is made from value-added services such as customs clearance, load consolidation and
intervention when problems occur, a core competency of DSV. We believe DSV can earn
more than 100 DKK per share in 2027 and see significant upside for one of Europe’s best
companies.
Cinemark
Earlier this year we took a stake in Cinemark, the third largest movie theater chain in the U.S.
We believe Cinemark is poised for underappreciated growth over the next few years as the
supply of theatrical releases rebounds from pandemic- and strike-related headwinds. In
addition, we believe Cinemark will gain share from undercapitalized competitors.
There is no shortage of skeptics about the move theater business. In 2020 the outlook for
domestic cinemas looked bleak: the rapid rise of streaming, combined with behavior changes
from the pandemic, cast doubt on whether people would ever go to theaters again. Regal
Cinemas filed for bankruptcy. AMC became a meme stock.
Against this inauspicious backdrop, Cinemark has demonstrated resilient financial
performance. Consider that in 2023, counterintuitively, Cinemark reported higher free cash
flow than they did in the two years prior to the pandemic. Yet, Cinemark stock entered 2024
Page 4

trading 70% below pre-pandemic levels (a mid-single digit multiple on trailing 12-month
free cash flow), suggesting market participants feared free cash flow would drop
precipitously and never recover. We disagree with this view and believe the multi-year
outlook for Cinemark has never been more robust.
Despite the recent success of films such as “Inside Out 2”, 2024 industry revenues are
expected to finish at approximately $8.5 billion, over 20% below pre-pandemic levels. While
many in the market attribute this to changing consumer preferences, the data demonstrates
theaters are a supply-driven industry (more films equal more foot traffic), and we believe
the key driver of weak box office revenues has been a 20% decrease in widescreen theatrical
releases since 2019. Importantly, we believe that this is driven by cyclical factors, namely
labor stoppages from the pandemic and subsequently the strikes, rather than secular factors.
Over the past three years, forays into exclusive streaming and day-and-date releases have
proven too unprofitable, and the “event” aspect of a theatrical release has proven critical to
securing top talent and creating franchise IP that can drive future earnings. As a result, all
six major Hollywood studios have committed to ramp volume back up to pre-COVID levels,
and even pureplay streamers like Amazon and Apple have begun releasing films exclusively
in theaters. We expect supply to rebound next year and reach the pre-COVID level by 2026,
which we expect to drive a full recovery in box office revenues as modestly lower per-film
attendance is offset by price increases and growth in concession revenues. In our view,
transient headwinds from the 2023 Hollywood strikes were masking this important secular
shift in film supply, which gave us the opportunity to initiate the investment at a dislocated
valuation.
Cinemark's earnings outperformance versus its peers through the pandemic has not been an
accident; while AMC and Regal have been closing screens and underinvesting to preserve
liquidity, Cinemark used what we see as a strong balance sheet and relentless focus on cost
efficiencies to sustain maintenance capex in their theaters despite the challenged operating
backdrop. As a result, the company has taken over 100 bps of market share, a trend we see
as sustainable as peers continue to rationalize their footprint despite an improving market.
Page 5

Given the significant recovery in box office, potential for continued share gain and high
operating leverage of the business, we think Cinemark can generate over $4 of FCF/share in
2026, which is meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels and should grow in the
following years. The company announced it will lay out its long-term capital allocation
strategy in early 2025, including a re-introduction of a dividend, which should be supportive
of a continued re-rating in the shares.
Credit Updates
Corporate Credit
Third Point’s corporate credit book generated a 3.5% gross return (3.4% net) during the
quarter, contributing 50 basis points to performance. That puts year-to-date performance
at +8.3% gross (8.2% net), in line with the high yield index. The summer proved anything
but cruel for high yield, with the market returning 5.3% during the quarter, in line with the
strong performance of the S&P 500. Spreads tightened marginally with most of the return
driven by the decline in interest rates.
While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition
of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration
has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market
have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive
events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to
date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber
building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. First, Lumen Technologies
(LUMN) announced that its Level 3 (LVLT) subsidiary was doing a fiber infrastructure build
to support AI growth. Our aversion to secular decline (most of LUMN is melting copper
infrastructure) kept us out of the situation but the AI fairy dust resulted in a massive rerating
of LUMN debt and equity. These higher security prices in turn facilitated several moves to
refinance portions of the capital structure and extend the runway.
Page 6

Second, Verizon (VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a
transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This
transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber
retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly
erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market,
the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.
Much has been written about “creditor on creditor violence” – liability management deals
where issuers are able to reduce their cost of capital or extend liquidity runways by offering
a subset of creditors a chance to move up the capital stack at the expense of their brethren.
These are frequently less than zero sum deals for creditors and primarily benefit financial
sponsors, and a large number end up restructuring anyway after paying enormous fees to
lawyers and advisors. As a result, we are seeing a rising number of creditor “co-op
agreements”, which serve to prevent sponsors from manipulating creditors. While we have
generally been very careful to position ourselves on the winning side of these skirmishes, we
are pleased to see the rise of these co-op agreements. Co-ops can make investing in highly
stressed situations more attractive because you can trust that a senior obligation does not
get leapfrogged by a junior obligation. Additionally, it seems likely that these co-ops will
accelerate the pace of restructurings, since sponsors will have limited options to buy time to
avoid equity write-offs.
While the high yield market has rallied, we have continued to find opportunity in a few areas.
We have bought into several credits that have gone through liability management deals.
These businesses were improving, and recapitalization was comprehensive enough to “fix”
the balance sheet. We are also finding value in several loan-only structures that have lagged
the rally in the high yield market.
Structured Credit
The Structured Credit portfolio contributed 20 basis points in the quarter, driven by
Treasuries and credit spreads rallying. While the Treasury market has likely overestimated
the magnitude of potential Fed rate cuts for this year, we took advantage of that market
Page 7

window and exercised our call rights on eight reperforming mortgage deals this quarter. We
priced a new mortgage securitization in August with AAA’s pricing inside of 5%, closer to
investment grade yields we saw in 2019 and early 2020. As insurance companies and private
credits funds actively look for investment grade risk, we have been able to access, in our
view, attractive cost of funds across structured credit loans. Given the decline in new
mortgage originations and newly issued mortgage-backed securities, we have seen an
improvement in the technical backdrop for existing securities and loans. We believe this
dynamic gives us an advantage as we continue to sell and optimize our existing mortgage
portfolio.
On the ABS front, yields have continued to compress across all asset classes. Spreads have
remained largely unchanged on our rental car ABS portfolio, which we bought earlier this
year at double digit yields. This has been a positive trade for the portfolio as we realize
significant carry each month. We have been monetizing our ABS positions into this credit
spread tightening and are spending more time on CLOs and CMBS as credit events start to
play out.
As we face geopolitical uncertainty and a volatile interest rate environment, we anticipate
interesting investment opportunities in the Fourth Quarter as investors look to protect a
solid 2024 performance.

The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed
on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third
Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser
headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure.
Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.
Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private
investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are
determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.
Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
Page 10

returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.
While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the
indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ
significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All information
provided herein is for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell securities. All investments

"Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd.",Daniel S. Loeb,"August 23, 2024",2024.0,2.0,1.8,S&P 500,4.3,-2.5,"The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure. Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

ANNUALIZED NET Q21 RETURN2 TP OFFSHORE FUND, LTD. 1.8% 13.1% CS HF EVENT-DRIVEN INDEX 1.5% 6.8% S&P 500 INDEX (TR) 4.3% 9.4% MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR) 2.8% 7.8% 1 Through June 30, 2024. 2 Annualized Return from inception (December 1996 for TP Offshore and quoted indices). CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE NEW SERIES RETURNS The top five winners for the quarter were TSMC, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Vistra Corp., and Apple Inc. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding hedges, were Bath & Body Works Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc., Ferguson PLC, Airbus SE, and Corpay Inc. During the first half of 2024, the Offshore Fund generated profits across all strategies, posting a 9.8% net return. For the previous 12 months, the fund returned 17.0% net. While returns over this period were largely driven by technology companies, much of the portfolio is invested in a range of sectors including utilities, industrials, consumer, and healthcare that provide diversification and balance to the portfolio. Single name short equities were an important source of alpha during the first half of the year, and corporate and structured credit have contributed steady gains with a fraction of the volatility and risk of equities. Our investments in the digital world including hyperscalers, consumer AI distribution platforms, and semiconductors have a key place in the portfolio, as we have discussed in previous letters. However, we are finding many investments in the “physical world” to be equally attractive. In a market consumed with technological disruption, we are focused on finding companies that are difficult to disrupt due to competitive moats, consolidated industry structures, unique products, or capital intensity that deter competitive investment. Examples include aggregates, nuclear power, life science tools, specialty alloy manufacturers, and commercial aerospace manufacturers. It is understandable that in a market whose narrative is dominated by the “Magnificent 7”, these businesses receive less attention, but that is giving us even more reason to add these types of names to the portfolio when we can find them. All investors know that early August brought tremendous volatility in equity markets. While indices have largely recovered, we expect that volatility will persist into year-end with a number of macro events – from Federal Reserve interest rate decisions; to the US elections; to the possibility of escalating conflict in the Middle East, to name just a few – contributing to a choppy environment. We modified certain exposures with this scenario in mind and worked quickly to mitigate losses during the downdraft. We are eager buyers of dislocated securities, particularly in credit, should we see further turmoil. Despite these risks, we seem to be entering a relatively benign macroeconomic environment generally, with decreasing inflation, declining interest rates, and economic growth slowing gradually. While the bottom quintile of consumers is doing poorly, shown by subprime, credit card and other data, higher income consumers are spending and confidence remains solid. Thematically, companies continue to invest in AI infrastructure and look for applications to their businesses, and other areas are starting to show increasing demand. While weakening pricing power is evident in sectors like consumer staples, we see strength in various materials, industrials and other sectors. We believe the portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of these trends in companies trading at what we see as fair to cheap valuations. We are closely watching the upcoming US election for potential risks from more populist economic policies such as higher taxes and increased regulation if the Democratic party wins the Presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. At the moment, we believe that there will be a divided government regardless of who wins the Presidential election, making some of the extreme and ill-advised measures such as taxes on unrealized capital gains, and a 44.6% top tax rate on long-term capital gains, more likely to be just campaign sound bites, rather than laws. The lower rate environment should also produce a wave of activity in credit transactions — both public and private — as well as a burst of M&A and equity capital markets transactions, in our view. Such a period would be welcome for our event-driven and credit strategies. Equities Updates Apple Inc. (AAPL) In April, we took a position in Apple, the world’s leading consumer technology franchise, with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets. Despite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned” by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low. We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years. We believe Apple’s recently announced “Apple Intelligence” suite of AI-enabled smartphone features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First, iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage. We believe Apple’s distribution advantage stems first and foremost from its unparalleled app ecosystem – which would be virtually impossible for any competing new technology platform to replicate given the powerful two-sided network effects linking app developers and app users. In addition, Apple has AI-specific product advantages conferred by its many years of work on proprietary silicon and data privacy. These advantages will be critical to the commercialization of an AI-enabled virtual assistant, which we believe may emerge as the first “killer app” for consumer-focused AI. And while we know little about the eventual capabilities and reach of this new offering, we believe the emergence of an AI layer on iOS will increasingly augment consumers’ own agencies with those of the iPhone’s AI features. If Apple can execute on this opportunity, the monetization form factors will follow and have the potential to increase Apple’s earnings meaningfully. This would not only be a sharp departure from the past several years of stagnant earnings growth, but also a direct repudiation of the consensus bear case. Despite the stock’s recent strong appreciation, we see room for significant upside ahead as the magnitude of this new AI opportunity surprises. Corpay (CPAY) This quarter we added to Corpay (formerly FLEETCOR), a position we initiated in the Fourth Quarter of 2023. Corpay is a collection of network assets in the payments space, most notably a fuel card business, where the company processes fuel purchases by commercial vehicle operators, and a B2B payments business where Corpay facilitates vendor payments for midmarket clients. These two segments together make up >70% of Corpay revenues. The company is run by CEO of 24 years, Ron Clarke, who in our view has delivered an impressive track record for shareholders of 20% compounded EPS growth since going public in 2010, including 15% over the last 10 years, through a combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and accretive capital allocation in M&A and share repurchases. Over the last five years, CPAY has seen its P/E multiple significantly de-rate from the mid-20s to ~13x as market sentiment toward the company's core fuel card business soured. Firstly, growth in the segment has slowed as the market has matured. Secondly, the rise in popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) as a theme has made investors question the terminal value of a business whose main function is to process gasoline and diesel payments. Corpay has proactively prepared for an EV transition by making acquisitions in EV charging payments and adding mixed/EV fleets to its customer base, wherein CPAY earns higher unit economics on mixed fleets than it does on pure internal combustion engine fleets. Finally, the last year has demonstrated that a transition to an electric fleet is more easily said than done. With EV sales declining for industry bellwether Tesla, European EV sales declining overall, and flattening in the US, it is becoming clear that the journey of automotive electrification will be a long one. Regarding revenue growth, we believe CPAY is at a unique juncture. While the fuel card segment slows to a more mature rate of growth, the company's B2B Payments business continues to grow at 15-20% per annum, . While this business came from humble beginnings in 2015 with the acquisition of Comdata, at the time $162 million and more than 10% of revenue, through what we believe was excellent execution and savvy M&A, this business segment has grown to $1.2 billion and 30% of revenue today. In the next couple years, we believe B2B Payments will overtake the fuel card segment to become Corpay's biggest business. We see this as a watershed moment for the stock, which will turn investor focus from the prior driver of Corpay’s revenue growth to the next one and will reassure investors that Corpay has many years of 10%+ EPS growth ahead. From a valuation perspective, it is incredibly rare to find a high EPS growth, high margin, high ROIC company trading at such a low valuation. We screened for companies with >50% EBITDA margins, 10-year EPS CAGR of >15% and 3-year median CFROI of >15%. There are just five companies in the S&P 500 with these characteristics: Nvidia, Visa, Mastercard, MSCI and Corpay. Corpay’s 13x P/E valuation in the company of these other four compounding juggernauts is remarkable. Finally, CEO Ron Clarke continues to show why, in our view, he belongs on the Mount Rushmore of capital allocators. Over the last six months, Corpay has deployed more than $2 billion in M&A and share repurchases, which together we think will be 7% accretive to 2025 earnings. We love giving our capital to seasoned operators with a track record of success and skin in the game, and we look forward to seeing him continue to create value for shareholders over the coming years. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) During Q2, we added to our position in Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). We originally invested in ICE in April 2023 when the FTC’s challenge to the company’s proposed acquisition of Black Knight impacted the share price. While the deal overhang has lifted, we believe a re-rating opportunity from a structural and cyclical acceleration of growth is still ahead. Importantly, we expect that AI will drive new growth opportunities across most of ICE’s businesses, extending the runway for value creation. ICE is a collection of dominant information services and exchange assets that automate diverse and large asset classes (Energy, Mortgages, Fixed Income, Rates and Equities) while producing vast amounts of proprietary data. CEO Jeff Sprecher has led ICE for over 20 years. Under his visionary leadership, the company has compounded organic revenue and EPS at ~5% and ~15%, respectively, and adopted new modalities through organic investment and strategic acquisitions, most notably creating the flagship clusters of Energy and Mortgage, franchises we believe are of very high business quality. On the horizon, we expect an acceleration of growth to a consistent low double digit organic algorithm in these businesses, and a re-rating of the stock as price follows value creation. ICE generates 30% of revenue from its Energy franchise, which holds dominant positions across the oil, natural gas, and environmental futures markets. In recent years, ICE’s Energy futures franchise has accelerated markedly, and we believe the 25% growth experienced in 2023 is set to sustain into 2024. This rapid growth is driven by rising demand for natural gas and the globalization of natural gas markets following the significant build out of liquified natural gas (LNG). We expect global natural gas demand to accelerate over the next several years due to the well-publicized growth in electricity demand in developed markets, as well as coal-to-gas switching in developing markets to reduce CO emissions. The pace of globalization of natural gas markets is also accelerating we believe due to a key innovation by US LNG exporters, who have modified LNG contracts from being long-term bilateral agreements with “destination clauses” to contracts where cargoes are purchased “free on board"" and can be directed by the buyer to any location on the globe subject to market prices in Asia and Europe. Both megatrends are benefiting ICE’s natural gas futures complex, specifically its seaborne TTF / JKM contracts that are central to LNG trading. ICE generates another 20% of revenue from its Mortgage franchise, which is the only scale software vendor in Mortgages. Following the acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Black Knight, ICE now has the building blocks needed to automate the highly analogue and parochial mortgage origination and servicing ecosystem in the US: over 50% market share in mortgage origination software, over 50% market share in mortgage servicing software, the largest third-party app marketplace, the system of record for mortgage servicing rights, and the definitive database for mortgage loan performance. By creating a 360-degree view of the customer, we believe ICE will ultimately create a life-of-loan platform that reduces the high costs and inefficient wait times of originating and servicing mortgage loans, while at the same time harnessing the vast amounts of mortgage data on its platforms for primary and secondary market participants to trade on. In less than a year since the acquisition of Black Knight, ICE has already had strong commercial success with cross-sell wins at J.P. Morgan, M&T Bank, Fifth Third Bank and Lennar to name a few, as well as new product rollouts like its GenAI conversational assistant for its servicing platform. As ICE consolidates the market on one end-to-end platform, it will also retain a significant portion of these productivity gains, in our view, fueling strong double-digit growth once we emerge from the mortgage market bottom in 2024. Credit Updates Corporate Credit Third Point corporate credit returned 4.4% gross (3.6% net) through the first half of 2024, outperforming the J.P. Morgan High Yield Index, which returned 2.6%. We suffered no material losses and our small position in GSE preferreds was up over 50%. Our relatively muted overall performance was due to a slower-than expected realization of the events that we expect will drive our positions higher, and continued weakness in the cable sector. We have both long and short positions in cable that we expect will perform well later this year as the winners and losers from changes in the competitive landscape become clear. Looking ahead, the table is set for increasing volatility and a broader opportunity set is already emerging. Overall credit spreads are tight, however this belies the underlying dispersion in the market. BB spreads are near their tightest levels ever in comparison to BBBs, while the ratio of CCC to B spreads is at its highest in history. We believe that this dispersion partly reflects a recognition that the long and variable lags associated with the impact of changes in monetary policy are coming home to roost. These impacts are likely to be further magnified by the excesses of 2020 and 2021 – peak deal volume at peak valuation and trough rates. The timing of the impact of higher rates on highly leveraged capitalizations is a function of the composition of the capital stack. Fixed rate debt and hedges can delay but not avoid this impact. The private credit market, which is overwhelmingly floating rate, provides a forward look and, from our viewpoint, it is messy. Middle market unitranche yields have been moving higher, pushing the percentage of private credit borrowers with fixed charge coverage ratios below 1x to 40%, according to an analysis by PIMCO and Lincoln International. While credits are generally more leveraged in private than public markets, we believe public markets will likewise face increasing stress as the impact of higher rates hits fixed rate issuers that have to refinance at higher rates. We expect these pressures to provide a wealth of opportunity in the secondary markets for public credit. Additionally, we continue to see the lines blurred between “public” and “private” credit, a trend we expect to accelerate as these stresses evolve. The syndicated leveraged loan market started as an essentially private market but evolved into a liquid secondary market as settlement procedures were standardized in the early 1990’s. We have already seen loans that began life as “private” trade, and we will be eager to take advantage of this new deal flow as more opportunities arise. Structured Credit We believe structured credit remains one of the last untapped markets for many institutional clients. We are seeing more insurance companies and private credit firms enter asset classes that we have been invested in for as long as seven years and welcome them to the table. Since the liquidity crisis some banks faced in March 2023, many credit funds have emerged to buy consumer loans, a trade we have executed with strategic venture partnerships since 2017 in our main funds and the dedicated structured credit funds. Today, private credit funds are driving up prices for sizeable loan trades from banks happy to sell and then provide expensive senior financing. We believe this market dynamic has created an exciting opportunity for us to refinance some of our mortgage loans with AAA spreads tightening from 165bps to 120bps in 2024. In our view, we have the benefit of existing strong performing collateral and the ability to combine with the smaller loan pools for a better arbitrage. We believe that active trading and sourcing new trades, which is a hallmark of our strategy, is also a key differentiator in this market, as nimble hedge funds can capitalize on market inefficiencies and/or dislocations, whether via early looks on mortgage securitizations or the ability to quickly assess the best risk/reward in rental car companies with public corporate debt and equity, as well as ABS. With the macroeconomic background pointing to potential rate cuts, we believe the Treasury market rally provides a tactical window to monetize risk through attractive senior financing while selloffs in specific credits will enable us to source cheaper bonds in the secondary market. We believe certain segments of our whole business and mortgage assets can experience meaningful capital appreciation if both the macroeconomic and asset-specific events play out over the next 12 months. In our reperforming mortgage deals, we have executed five refinancings and have seven more in the pipeline. As rates rally and concerns of a recession re-emerge, mounting credit issues in public corporate credit and commercial real estate should present interesting opportunities for us to reinvest amidst the volatility. In addition, as the leveraged loan market in our view is heavily relying on amending maturities and extending into 2025 and 2026, we will see CLO managers tested, as “covenant lite” loans need to be restructured and 60% of borrowers in US BSL CLOs have PE-backed sponsors that are waiting for painful and protracted negotiations. We anticipate increased opportunities in the corporate and real estate markets as credit deteriorates. In our US residential housing exposure, we remain excited about the current return profile and capital appreciation potential as rates trend lower. We are long duration in our mortgage exposure and the rate rally provides a promising tailwind to our projected return profile.

important source of alpha during the first half of the year, and corporate and structured
credit have contributed steady gains with a fraction of the volatility and risk of equities.
Our investments in the digital world including hyperscalers, consumer AI distribution
platforms, and semiconductors have a key place in the portfolio, as we have discussed in
previous letters. However, we are finding many investments in the “physical world” to be
equally attractive. In a market consumed with technological disruption, we are focused on
finding companies that are difficult to disrupt due to competitive moats, consolidated
industry structures, unique products, or capital intensity that deter competitive investment.
Examples include aggregates, nuclear power, life science tools, specialty alloy
manufacturers, and commercial aerospace manufacturers. It is understandable that in a
market whose narrative is dominated by the “Magnificent 7”, these businesses receive less
attention, but that is giving us even more reason to add these types of names to the portfolio
when we can find them.
All investors know that early August brought tremendous volatility in equity markets. While
indices have largely recovered, we expect that volatility will persist into year-end with a
number of macro events – from Federal Reserve interest rate decisions; to the US elections;
to the possibility of escalating conflict in the Middle East, to name just a few – contributing
to a choppy environment. We modified certain exposures with this scenario in mind and
worked quickly to mitigate losses during the downdraft. We are eager buyers of dislocated
securities, particularly in credit, should we see further turmoil.
Despite these risks, we seem to be entering a relatively benign macroeconomic environment
generally, with decreasing inflation, declining interest rates, and economic growth slowing
gradually. While the bottom quintile of consumers is doing poorly, shown by subprime,
credit card and other data, higher income consumers are spending and confidence remains
solid. Thematically, companies continue to invest in AI infrastructure and look for
applications to their businesses, and other areas are starting to show increasing demand.
While weakening pricing power is evident in sectors like consumer staples, we see strength
in various materials, industrials and other sectors. We believe the portfolio is well-

positioned to take advantage of these trends in companies trading at what we see as fair to
cheap valuations.
We are closely watching the upcoming US election for potential risks from more populist
economic policies such as higher taxes and increased regulation if the Democratic party wins
the Presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. At the moment, we believe that there
will be a divided government regardless of who wins the Presidential election, making some
of the extreme and ill-advised measures such as taxes on unrealized capital gains, and a
44.6% top tax rate on long-term capital gains, more likely to be just campaign sound bites,
rather than laws.
The lower rate environment should also produce a wave of activity in credit transactions —
both public and private — as well as a burst of M&A and equity capital markets transactions,
in our view. Such a period would be welcome for our event-driven and credit strategies.
Equities Updates
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
In April, we took a position in Apple, the world’s leading consumer technology franchise,
with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including
smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in
most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.
Despite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned”
by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low.
We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by
more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different
conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s
revenue and earnings over the next few years.
We believe Apple’s recently announced “Apple Intelligence” suite of AI-enabled smartphone

features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start
driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating
revenue growth on two fronts. First, iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement
because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone
models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely
to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps such
as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple recently announced a partnership). We expect
Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its
distribution advantage.
We believe Apple’s distribution advantage stems first and foremost from its unparalleled app
ecosystem – which would be virtually impossible for any competing new technology
platform to replicate given the powerful two-sided network effects linking app developers
and app users. In addition, Apple has AI-specific product advantages conferred by its many
years of work on proprietary silicon and data privacy. These advantages will be critical to
the commercialization of an AI-enabled virtual assistant, which we believe may emerge as
the first “killer app” for consumer-focused AI. And while we know little about the eventual
capabilities and reach of this new offering, we believe the emergence of an AI layer on iOS
will increasingly augment consumers’ own agencies with those of the iPhone’s AI features.
If Apple can execute on this opportunity, the monetization form factors will follow and have
the potential to increase Apple’s earnings meaningfully. This would not only be a sharp
departure from the past several years of stagnant earnings growth, but also a direct
repudiation of the consensus bear case. Despite the stock’s recent strong appreciation, we
see room for significant upside ahead as the magnitude of this new AI opportunity surprises.
Corpay (CPAY)
This quarter we added to Corpay (formerly FLEETCOR), a position we initiated in the Fourth
Quarter of 2023. Corpay is a collection of network assets in the payments space, most notably
a fuel card business, where the company processes fuel purchases by commercial vehicle
operators, and a B2B payments business where Corpay facilitates vendor payments for
Page 4

midmarket clients. These two segments together make up >70% of Corpay revenues. The
company is run by CEO of 24 years, Ron Clarke, who in our view has delivered an impressive
track record for shareholders of 20% compounded EPS growth since going public in 2010,
including 15% over the last 10 years, through a combination of revenue growth, margin
expansion, and accretive capital allocation in M&A and share repurchases.
Over the last five years, CPAY has seen its P/E multiple significantly de-rate from the mid-
20s to ~13x as market sentiment toward the company's core fuel card business soured.
Firstly, growth in the segment has slowed as the market has matured. Secondly, the rise in
popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) as a theme has made investors question the terminal
value of a business whose main function is to process gasoline and diesel payments. Corpay
has proactively prepared for an EV transition by making acquisitions in EV charging
payments and adding mixed/EV fleets to its customer base, wherein CPAY earns higher unit
economics on mixed fleets than it does on pure internal combustion engine fleets. Finally,
the last year has demonstrated that a transition to an electric fleet is more easily said than
done. With EV sales declining for industry bellwether Tesla, European EV sales declining
overall, and flattening in the US, it is becoming clear that the journey of automotive
electrification will be a long one.
Regarding revenue growth, we believe CPAY is at a unique juncture. While the fuel card
organically
segment slows to a more mature rate of growth, the company's B2B Payments business
continues to grow at 15-20% per annum, . While this business came from humble
beginnings in 2015 with the acquisition of Comdata, at the time $162 million and more than
10% of revenue, through what we believe was excellent execution and savvy M&A, this
business segment has grown to $1.2 billion and 30% of revenue today. In the next couple
years, we believe B2B Payments will overtake the fuel card segment to become Corpay's
biggest business. We see this as a watershed moment for the stock, which will turn investor
focus from the prior driver of Corpay’s revenue growth to the next one and will reassure
investors that Corpay has many years of 10%+ EPS growth ahead.
Page 5

From a valuation perspective, it is incredibly rare to find a high EPS growth, high margin,
high ROIC company trading at such a low valuation. We screened for companies with >50%
EBITDA margins, 10-year EPS CAGR of >15% and 3-year median CFROI of >15%. There are
just five companies in the S&P 500 with these characteristics: Nvidia, Visa, Mastercard, MSCI
and Corpay. Corpay’s 13x P/E valuation in the company of these other four compounding
juggernauts is remarkable.
Finally, CEO Ron Clarke continues to show why, in our view, he belongs on the Mount
Rushmore of capital allocators. Over the last six months, Corpay has deployed more than $2
billion in M&A and share repurchases, which together we think will be 7% accretive to 2025
earnings. We love giving our capital to seasoned operators with a track record of success and
skin in the game, and we look forward to seeing him continue to create value for
shareholders over the coming years.
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
During Q2, we added to our position in Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). We originally
invested in ICE in April 2023 when the FTC’s challenge to the company’s proposed
acquisition of Black Knight impacted the share price. While the deal overhang has lifted, we
believe a re-rating opportunity from a structural and cyclical acceleration of growth is still
ahead. Importantly, we expect that AI will drive new growth opportunities across most of
ICE’s businesses, extending the runway for value creation.
ICE is a collection of dominant information services and exchange assets that automate
diverse and large asset classes (Energy, Mortgages, Fixed Income, Rates and Equities) while
producing vast amounts of proprietary data. CEO Jeff Sprecher has led ICE for over 20 years.
Under his visionary leadership, the company has compounded organic revenue and EPS at
~5% and ~15%, respectively, and adopted new modalities through organic investment and
strategic acquisitions, most notably creating the flagship clusters of Energy and Mortgage,
franchises we believe are of very high business quality. On the horizon, we expect an
acceleration of growth to a consistent low double digit organic algorithm in these businesses,
and a re-rating of the stock as price follows value creation.
Page 6

ICE generates 30% of revenue from its Energy franchise, which holds dominant positions
across the oil, natural gas, and environmental futures markets. In recent years, ICE’s Energy
futures franchise has accelerated markedly, and we believe the 25% growth experienced in
2023 is set to sustain into 2024. This rapid growth is driven by rising demand for natural gas
and the globalization of natural gas markets following the significant build out of liquified
natural gas (LNG). We expect global natural gas demand to accelerate over the next several
years due to the well-publicized growth in electricity demand in developed markets, as well
2
as coal-to-gas switching in developing markets to reduce CO emissions. The pace of
globalization of natural gas markets is also accelerating we believe due to a key innovation
by US LNG exporters, who have modified LNG contracts from being long-term bilateral
agreements with “destination clauses” to contracts where cargoes are purchased “free on
board"" and can be directed by the buyer to any location on the globe subject to market prices
in Asia and Europe. Both megatrends are benefiting ICE’s natural gas futures complex,
specifically its seaborne TTF / JKM contracts that are central to LNG trading.
ICE generates another 20% of revenue from its Mortgage franchise, which is the only scale
software vendor in Mortgages. Following the acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Black Knight, ICE
now has the building blocks needed to automate the highly analogue and parochial mortgage
origination and servicing ecosystem in the US: over 50% market share in mortgage
origination software, over 50% market share in mortgage servicing software, the largest
third-party app marketplace, the system of record for mortgage servicing rights, and the
definitive database for mortgage loan performance. By creating a 360-degree view of the
customer, we believe ICE will ultimately create a life-of-loan platform that reduces the high
costs and inefficient wait times of originating and servicing mortgage loans, while at the
same time harnessing the vast amounts of mortgage data on its platforms for primary and
secondary market participants to trade on.
In less than a year since the acquisition of Black Knight, ICE has already had strong
commercial success with cross-sell wins at J.P. Morgan, M&T Bank, Fifth Third Bank and
Lennar to name a few, as well as new product rollouts like its GenAI conversational assistant
Page 7

for its servicing platform. As ICE consolidates the market on one end-to-end platform, it will
also retain a significant portion of these productivity gains, in our view, fueling strong
double-digit growth once we emerge from the mortgage market bottom in 2024.
Credit Updates
Corporate Credit
Third Point corporate credit returned 4.4% gross (3.6% net) through the first half of 2024,
outperforming the J.P. Morgan High Yield Index, which returned 2.6%. We suffered no
material losses and our small position in GSE preferreds was up over 50%. Our relatively
muted overall performance was due to a slower-than expected realization of the events that
we expect will drive our positions higher, and continued weakness in the cable sector. We
have both long and short positions in cable that we expect will perform well later this year
as the winners and losers from changes in the competitive landscape become clear.
Looking ahead, the table is set for increasing volatility and a broader opportunity set is
already emerging. Overall credit spreads are tight, however this belies the underlying
dispersion in the market. BB spreads are near their tightest levels ever in comparison to
BBBs, while the ratio of CCC to B spreads is at its highest in history. We believe that this
dispersion partly reflects a recognition that the long and variable lags associated with the
impact of changes in monetary policy are coming home to roost.
These impacts are likely to be further magnified by the excesses of 2020 and 2021 – peak
deal volume at peak valuation and trough rates. The timing of the impact of higher rates on
highly leveraged capitalizations is a function of the composition of the capital stack. Fixed
rate debt and hedges can delay but not avoid this impact. The private credit market, which
is overwhelmingly floating rate, provides a forward look and, from our viewpoint, it is messy.
Middle market unitranche yields have been moving higher, pushing the percentage of private
credit borrowers with fixed charge coverage ratios below 1x to 40%, according to an analysis
by PIMCO and Lincoln International.
Page 8

While credits are generally more leveraged in private than public markets, we believe public
markets will likewise face increasing stress as the impact of higher rates hits fixed rate
issuers that have to refinance at higher rates. We expect these pressures to provide a wealth
of opportunity in the secondary markets for public credit.
Additionally, we continue to see the lines blurred between “public” and “private” credit, a
trend we expect to accelerate as these stresses evolve. The syndicated leveraged loan market
started as an essentially private market but evolved into a liquid secondary market as
settlement procedures were standardized in the early 1990’s. We have already seen loans
that began life as “private” trade, and we will be eager to take advantage of this new deal flow
as more opportunities arise.
Structured Credit
We believe structured credit remains one of the last untapped markets for many institutional
clients. We are seeing more insurance companies and private credit firms enter asset classes
that we have been invested in for as long as seven years and welcome them to the table. Since
the liquidity crisis some banks faced in March 2023, many credit funds have emerged to buy
consumer loans, a trade we have executed with strategic venture partnerships since 2017 in
our main funds and the dedicated structured credit funds. Today, private credit funds are
driving up prices for sizeable loan trades from banks happy to sell and then provide
expensive senior financing.
We believe this market dynamic has created an exciting opportunity for us to refinance some
of our mortgage loans with AAA spreads tightening from 165bps to 120bps in 2024. In our
view, we have the benefit of existing strong performing collateral and the ability to combine
with the smaller loan pools for a better arbitrage. We believe that active trading and sourcing
new trades, which is a hallmark of our strategy, is also a key differentiator in this market, as
nimble hedge funds can capitalize on market inefficiencies and/or dislocations, whether via
early looks on mortgage securitizations or the ability to quickly assess the best risk/reward
in rental car companies with public corporate debt and equity, as well as ABS.
Page 9

With the macroeconomic background pointing to potential rate cuts, we believe the Treasury
market rally provides a tactical window to monetize risk through attractive senior financing
while selloffs in specific credits will enable us to source cheaper bonds in the secondary
market. We believe certain segments of our whole business and mortgage assets can
experience meaningful capital appreciation if both the macroeconomic and asset-specific
events play out over the next 12 months. In our reperforming mortgage deals, we have
executed five refinancings and have seven more in the pipeline. As rates rally and concerns
of a recession re-emerge, mounting credit issues in public corporate credit and commercial
real estate should present interesting opportunities for us to reinvest amidst the volatility.
In addition, as the leveraged loan market in our view is heavily relying on amending
maturities and extending into 2025 and 2026, we will see CLO managers tested, as “covenant
lite” loans need to be restructured and 60% of borrowers in US BSL CLOs have PE-backed
sponsors that are waiting for painful and protracted negotiations.
We anticipate increased opportunities in the corporate and real estate markets as credit
deteriorates. In our US residential housing exposure, we remain excited about the current
return profile and capital appreciation potential as rates trend lower. We are long duration
in our mortgage exposure and the rate rally provides a promising tailwind to our projected
return profile.

The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed
on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third
Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser
headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure.
Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.
Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private
investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are
determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.
Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period.

The reported net return figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return.

Individual investor returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.

The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which trades under the ticker symbol SPY.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of that index.

In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of dividends would increase the reported figures.

Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.

DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker symbol DIA.

Reinvested dividends are included in these figures.

A spreadsheet showing the DIA performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.

While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor would earn following a passive investment approach.

The NASDAQ declined over 22% in the quarter and was down nearly 30% in the first six months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all down more than 10% in the quarter, and other than the DJIA, were down over 20% in the first half. Cedar Creek declined by 10.2% in the second quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was down 9.7% in the first six months, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen and a half year history is 13.4%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 688%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘22 1H ‘22 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -10.2% -9.7% 687.6% 13.4% NASDAQ -22.4% -29.5% 376.0% 9.9% DJIA (DIA) -10.8% -14.5% 310.8% 9.0% S&P 500 (SPY) -16.1% -20.0% 304.9% 8.9% Russell 2000 -17.2% -23.4% 200.6% 6.9% Russell Microcap -19.0% -25.1% 145.4% 5.6% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $787,576 as of June 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $245,365 in the Russell Micro Cap and $475,984 in the NASDAQ. 1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and under 5 times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.2. Dividend yield was 0.6%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was 18.9%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 14%. The big increase was primarily due to the settlement and sale of shares in Nocopi Technologies (NNUP) and new money coming in. On the buy side, late in the quarter we started building large positions in two microcap companies that we think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are trading at less than eight times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow in excess of 20% annually for the next ten years without the need for additional capital. Due to the low current price-to-earnings ratio, we think the average annual return for the two stocks will exceed their growth rate if the market re-rates the stocks to a higher P/E multiple. We expect to provide more detail in our Q3 or yearend letter, depending on when we are finished buying. If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the fund’s sixteen-year history, they are certainly in the top three! We are trying to steadily buy without pushing up the share prices, which is extremely difficult in microcaps. We purchased shares in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The attraction is the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern is the contract with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net cash balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share. Harbor earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted from funds from the payroll support program. They should be able to earn $0.60 per share before the expiration of the capacity agreement. The stock currently trades at round $2.20 per share. In addition, we increased our holdings in Western Capital Resources (WCRS) after it declined sharply due to their decision to go dark. Shares are currently under $5 per share. The company has $5.77 per share in net cash, and trailing earnings of $1.15 per share. The company repurchased shares last September at $7. It is 80% owned by Blackstreet and management. We expect the stock to end up on the expert tier or possibly not even trade at all. They did say they expect to make annual repurchase offers, but who knows what the valuation will be. Expert Market Exposure We continue to increase our exposure to shares trading in the expert market. These are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 19% exposure and ended at 22% of the fund. 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We sold out of CCUR (CCUR) at a loss, and we received proceeds from the buyout of Adfitech (ADFT). We made roughly 70% on Adfitech in less than a year. Unfortunately, there was just never any liquidity to make it a meaningful position. Better a small gain than no gain. As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 23% of the fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 6% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is over 4%, as is Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG). We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter (link). Pacific Coast Oil Trust Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is an expert market stock. It is one of the more complicated and interesting stories we have come across. It is an oil and gas trust that was sold to the public in 2012 at $20 per unit. The trust gives unit holders the right to 80% of cashflow after the payment of production and development costs for oil fields located in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. At the time it went public the seller, Pacific Coast Energy Company (PCEC), formerly BreitBurn Energy, was retaining 52% of the trust units and selling 48% to the public.3 Fast forward a few years, oil prices had declined from $100 per barrel to $60 and production had declined from 3,400 barrels per day to 2,200 resulting in sharply lower distributions. By 2018 the trust was trading between $2 and $2.50 per unit and paying roughly $0.30 per unit annually. In September 2019 PCEC was acquired by NewBridge Resources. Just a few weeks later, in October 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the trust’s auditors resigned. In the 8-K filing on October 4, 2019 it stated, “PwC advised the Trust that information had come to PwC’s attention that causes PwC to be unwilling to be associated with the Trust’s financial statements in the future.” You don’t see that every day. The November 13, 2019 8-K notes that a 50% owner of NewBridge was or may have been affiliated with a company that filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Clearly there was more to the story. We have read unconfirmed reports that allege the buyers have criminal records that include embezzlement and insider trading. Talk about messy. Yet we aren’t actually done yet. That is only the who and the what, it is the how and the why that complete the picture. In the same November filing, PCEC notified the trust that PCEC intended to deduct future plugging and abandonment costs (also known as asset retirement obligations, or ARO) from the amounts otherwise payable to the Trust under its Net Profits Interest beginning January 2020. The amount of estimated cost was $56.7 million. Annual payout from the trust at the time was about $10-11 million. The costs were not expected to occur for a number of years. Some wells were expected to be exhausted within five years, while for other wells it would be thirty years or more into the future. The assessment would result in no payments to unit holders for a number of years, which would trigger a clause forcing sale of the trust. The trustee must have pushed back because PCEC commissioned Moss Adams to assist in determining the estimated asset retirement obligation (ARO). Moss Adams calculated it at $45.7 million, which was $11 million lower than before but would still trigger an eventual sale. The trust commissioned their own study by Martindale and came up with $28.7 million and communicated that the trust conveyance permits the amount to be accrued versus how PCEC wanted to treat it (all up front). It seems that the new owners of PCEC wanted to charge it up front knowing it would force sale of the trust in two years, and give PCEC all the cash flows in the interim.4 The trustee wanted to amortize the ARO over five years believing that was most equitable to unit holders, which was logical, but probably not consistent with GAAP (generally accepted accounted principles) which would require recognizing the present value of the liability immediately. The prospect of no further distributions sent the unit prices plummeting to 30 cents. No quarterly or annual filings were filed as there was no auditor. Unit holders did get monthly updates via press releases and 8-K filings from the trustee on production, revenues, expenses, operating income and the 80% net profit interest. Then COVID hit and oil plummeted from $60 per barrel to near $0 before resettling around $30 and slowly climbing back toward $60 by fall 2021. Due to COVID PCEC shut some production in. In July 2020 a unitholder filed suit. Unit prices fell to around 10 cents. Then it got even stranger. PCEC’s CEO who had the troubled past was ousted and supposedly blew the whistle in court. To make a long story a bit shorter. The court granted standing and prohibited dissolution of the trust. That eventually led to a three person arbitration panel that decided for PCEC, but that decision is still on hold pending settlement discussions. Units are currently trading around $0.32 per unit. So why did we buy units? We came to the conclusion that there were only a few likely outcomes: 1) Worst case – Unitholders have to pay full ARO and it leads to Dissolution of Trust. The two years of no payments by the trust has already occurred (from spring 2019 to spring 2021), and assuming court decisions all go against unitholders it would lead to an auction of the interests, where after payment of what remains of the ARO the remaining balance of the proceeds would go to unitholders. In this scenario time is our friend, particularly now that oil has risen to around $100 per barrel. As of May 2022, the higher estimate of the ARO remaining was $14.3 million and the balance was declining at about $1.5 million per month. By the time of an auction it could be paid off or nearly so. With oil at $100 the trust is generating roughly $4.5 million per quarter or $0.12 per unit. What would an investor pay for the that? Assuming a conservative three-year payback for the buyer comes to $1.50, and a 5x return for the fund from current prices. If the buyer assumes oil averages $80 per barrel, then cash flow is $12 million per year, or $0.32 per unit, and a three-year payback valuation comes to $1 per unit or 3x the current price. 2) Some kind of settlement where PCEC buys out unitholders or agrees to amortize the ARO. A buyout would likely have a similar valuation of the worst case scenario. A settlement about ARO treatment would result in the trust continuing in existence and unit holders receiving monthly payments. With oil at $100, the trust would earn $0.12 per unit per quarter. What is that worth in the (expert) market if the ARO issue is settled? We think more than the worst case. 3) Bonanza – somehow the court finds PCEC acted inappropriately, or it finds that a major portion of the ARO has already been assessed. We noted to the group filing suit that the original prospectus noted that $22.3 million of ARO had already been accrued before the trust was created.5 Thus we think it is possible, if not likely, that PCEC is charging something that was already (partially) accrued for. If so, that is $0.66 per unit based on 38 million units outstanding. The value of the units could be near $2 or more. The bottom line is we don’t know precisely what the units are worth, but our analysis concluded that it is likely more than the current price. We made it a 4% position in the fund. Hopefully we are not missing a key issue. Time will tell. 4 As best we can tell, the funds did not need to be segregated in a separate account. It may be that PCEC could use the funds for other purposes while retaining the liability. 5 See note 7 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001538822/000119312512212391/d273119d424b1.htm BM Technologies In our third quarter 2021 letter we profiled BM Technologies (BMTX) a fintech company. Almost immediately after we purchased the shares, the price jumped by 40%. We trimmed the position. Soon after the price began declining. To refresh your memory, BMTX was originally part of Customers Bancorp (CUBI). It was sold to Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp., a SPAC. BMTX has developed a fintech banking platform which provides digital banking and disbursement services to consumers and students in the United States. It facilitates deposits and banking products and services between customers and partner banks. The company provides access to a suite of banking products, including checking, savings, personal loans, credit cards, and student refinancing. They are not a traditional bank. It is a white label platform for other companies such as T-Mobile. Approximately half of BMTX’s revenue is from payments by Customers Bancorp for roughly $2 billion of deposits, and technically a sharing of the net interest margin Customers expected to earn. (It looks like it was a sweetheart deal. The CEO of BMTX, Luvleen Sidhu, is the daughter of the CEO of Customers, Jay Sidhu). Customers essentially has been paying BMTX just over 2.75% for their deposits. Late in 2021 Customers informed BMTX that it would not be continuing the relationship after the end of 2022. In a near zero interest rate environment, BMTX had a problem. They were going to see earnings drop precipitously in 2023 as it was highly unlikely they would receive nearly 3% for deposits. Trailing adjusted EBITDA was $2.40 per share. If they only earned 1% on the deposits, EBITDA would be breakeven or slightly negative. BMTX’s solution was to purchase a small bank and bring the deposits in house. They agreed to buy First Sound Bank (FSWA) for $25 million. The problem is the level of deposits would far exceed the bank’s capital necessitating a large capital raise, which would significantly dilute shareholders. At best net income would hold steady but the share count would double or possibly triple, meaning earnings per share would decline by 1/2 to 1/3. And that assumes they rapidly built up a lending team and loan portfolio, which does not happen overnight. Another issue also came up at the beginning of the year. BMTX had to restate their financials due to how they treated some stock compensation. Previously the cost had been borne by Customers Bancorp, but auditors decided BMTX should have amortized it over calendar 2021 and 2022. BMTX made the adjustment, filed its annual report, and then dismissed its auditors. Just one of the major issues BMTX faced - needing a capital raise when you are seen as desperate, are associated with a former SPAC, have had an accounting issue that led to changing auditors, and being in the midst of a sharply declining market – would be a challenge. Facing all was a perfect storm. Buyers were waiting for a bottom. Then inflation kicked up, pushing interest rates up. BMTX went from the likelihood of having the 2.75% service revenue on its deposits declining to less than 1%, to potentially having no drop at all. One-year CD rates are now 3% and have been trending higher. BMTX can broker the deposits out to numerous banks and replace the relationship with Customers. Today, they may be buying a bank they don’t actually need, but that is a much better problem than what they faced six months ago. The strange thing is that the market has not made an adjustment. The stock has languished at $6 per share, which is just 2.5 times trailing adjusted EBITDA of $2.40 per share. BMTX has no debt and we estimate end of June 2022 cash levels to be close to $35 million, or nearly $3 per share. While $25 million will go to buying First Sound, they will still have a solid balance sheet. BMTX announced hiring KPMG as auditors this week, and we expect them to be current in their filings by mid-September. The risks are that rates decrease. Despite what the current administration says, we are technically in a recession – two successive quarters of negative GDP. Are we likely to return to zero interest rate policy? Probably not, but that does not mean rates won’t be lower a year from now. The inverted yield curve also implies rates in the future will be lower. Having spoken with BMTX’s CFO, we think BMTX has a proper understanding of the situation and will act rationally. Our hope is that BMTX is able to stay a fintech company and not turn completely into a bank that is subject to regulatory capital requirements. As a fintech they can earn much higher returns on equity and will not need to keep all that equity in the business. For the moment, we think the current valuation of just over one times EBITDA, net of cash is absurdly low. Assuming the bank purchase closes, the valuation is two times EBITDA net of cash, plus the value of the bank. Barring a drastic change in the other parts of the business, the downside scenario is the company functioning at breakeven. If that occurred two years from now cash would equal the current value of the company. Thus, we think the downside is very minimal, and the upside substantial. In addition, they are still working on gaining additional white label partners, and were successful in the first quarter, and deposits are still growing. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Near double digit inflation and increasing interest rates led to a large market decline in the
second quarter. The NASDAQ declined over 22% in the quarter and was down nearly 30%
in the first six months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all
down more than 10% in the quarter, and other than the DJIA, were down over 20% in the
first half. Cedar Creek declined by 10.2% in the second quarter, net of fees and expenses,
and was down 9.7% in the first six months, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen and a half year history is 13.4%, net
of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against.
Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 688%, net of fees and expenses.
Q2 ‘22 1H ‘22 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek -10.2% -9.7% 687.6% 13.4%
NASDAQ -22.4% -29.5% 376.0% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) -10.8% -14.5% 310.8% 9.0%
S&P 500 (SPY) -16.1% -20.0% 304.9% 8.9%
Russell 2000 -17.2% -23.4% 200.6% 6.9%
Russell Microcap -19.0% -25.1% 145.4% 5.6%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $787,576
as of June 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes
we compare against would have only grown to between $245,365 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $475,984 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less
than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and under 5 times
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.2.
Dividend yield was 0.6%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was 18.9%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 14%. The big
increase was primarily due to the settlement and sale of shares in Nocopi Technologies
(NNUP) and new money coming in.
On the buy side, late in the quarter we started building large positions in two microcap
companies that we think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are
trading at less than eight times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow in excess
of 20% annually for the next ten years without the need for additional capital. Due to the
low current price-to-earnings ratio, we think the average annual return for the two stocks
will exceed their growth rate if the market re-rates the stocks to a higher P/E multiple. We
expect to provide more detail in our Q3 or yearend letter, depending on when we are
finished buying. If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the
fund’s sixteen-year history, they are certainly in the top three! We are trying to steadily
buy without pushing up the share prices, which is extremely difficult in microcaps.
We purchased shares in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the
holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The
attraction is the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern is the contract
with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net cash
balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share. Harbor
earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted from
funds from the payroll support program. They should be able to earn $0.60 per share
before the expiration of the capacity agreement. The stock currently trades at round $2.20
per share.
In addition, we increased our holdings in Western Capital Resources (WCRS) after it
declined sharply due to their decision to go dark. Shares are currently under $5 per share.
The company has $5.77 per share in net cash, and trailing earnings of $1.15 per share.
The company repurchased shares last September at $7. It is 80% owned by Blackstreet
and management. We expect the stock to end up on the expert tier or possibly not even
trade at all. They did say they expect to make annual repurchase offers, but who knows
what the valuation will be.
Expert Market Exposure
We continue to increase our exposure to shares trading in the expert market. These are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the
buying restriction. We started the quarter with 19% exposure and ended at 22% of the
fund.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

We sold out of CCUR (CCUR) at a loss, and we received proceeds from the buyout of
Adfitech (ADFT). We made roughly 70% on Adfitech in less than a year. Unfortunately,
there was just never any liquidity to make it a meaningful position. Better a small gain
than no gain.
As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 23% of the
fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 6% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL) is over 4%, as is Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG). We discussed PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021
letter (link).
Pacific Coast Oil Trust
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is an expert market stock. It is one of the more complicated
and interesting stories we have come across. It is an oil and gas trust that was sold to the
public in 2012 at $20 per unit. The trust gives unit holders the right to 80% of cashflow
after the payment of production and development costs for oil fields located in Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara counties. At the time it went public the seller, Pacific Coast Energy
Company (PCEC), formerly BreitBurn Energy, was retaining 52% of the trust units and
selling 48% to the public.3
Fast forward a few years, oil prices had declined from $100 per barrel to $60 and
production had declined from 3,400 barrels per day to 2,200 resulting in sharply lower
distributions. By 2018 the trust was trading between $2 and $2.50 per unit and paying
roughly $0.30 per unit annually. In September 2019 PCEC was acquired by NewBridge
Resources. Just a few weeks later, in October 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the
trust’s auditors resigned. In the 8-K filing on October 4, 2019 it stated, “PwC advised the
Trust that information had come to PwC’s attention that causes PwC to be unwilling to be
associated with the Trust’s financial statements in the future.” You don’t see that every
day. The November 13, 2019 8-K notes that a 50% owner of NewBridge was or may have
been affiliated with a company that filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Clearly there was more to
the story. We have read unconfirmed reports that allege the buyers have criminal records
that include embezzlement and insider trading. Talk about messy. Yet we aren’t actually
done yet. That is only the who and the what, it is the how and the why that complete the
picture.
In the same November filing, PCEC notified the trust that PCEC intended to deduct future
plugging and abandonment costs (also known as asset retirement obligations, or ARO) from
the amounts otherwise payable to the Trust under its Net Profits Interest beginning January
2020. The amount of estimated cost was $56.7 million. Annual payout from the trust at
the time was about $10-11 million. The costs were not expected to occur for a number of
years. Some wells were expected to be exhausted within five years, while for other wells it
would be thirty years or more into the future. The assessment would result in no payments
to unit holders for a number of years, which would trigger a clause forcing sale of the trust.
The trustee must have pushed back because PCEC commissioned Moss Adams to assist in
determining the estimated asset retirement obligation (ARO). Moss Adams calculated it at
$45.7 million, which was $11 million lower than before but would still trigger an eventual
sale. The trust commissioned their own study by Martindale and came up with $28.7
million and communicated that the trust conveyance permits the amount to be accrued
versus how PCEC wanted to treat it (all up front). It seems that the new owners of PCEC
3 In 2013 PCEC sold 85% of the remaining units it held in a secondary offering at $17, and then in June 2014 sold
the remaining units at $13.

wanted to charge it up front knowing it would force sale of the trust in two years, and give
PCEC all the cash flows in the interim.4 The trustee wanted to amortize the ARO over five
years believing that was most equitable to unit holders, which was logical, but probably not
consistent with GAAP (generally accepted accounted principles) which would require
recognizing the present value of the liability immediately.
The prospect of no further distributions sent the unit prices plummeting to 30 cents. No
quarterly or annual filings were filed as there was no auditor. Unit holders did get monthly
updates via press releases and 8-K filings from the trustee on production, revenues,
expenses, operating income and the 80% net profit interest. Then COVID hit and oil
plummeted from $60 per barrel to near $0 before resettling around $30 and slowly climbing
back toward $60 by fall 2021. Due to COVID PCEC shut some production in. In July 2020
a unitholder filed suit. Unit prices fell to around 10 cents. Then it got even stranger.
PCEC’s CEO who had the troubled past was ousted and supposedly blew the whistle in
court. To make a long story a bit shorter. The court granted standing and prohibited
dissolution of the trust. That eventually led to a three person arbitration panel that decided
for PCEC, but that decision is still on hold pending settlement discussions.
Units are currently trading around $0.32 per unit. So why did we buy units? We came to
the conclusion that there were only a few likely outcomes:
1) Worst case – Unitholders have to pay full ARO and it leads to Dissolution of Trust. The
two years of no payments by the trust has already occurred (from spring 2019 to spring
2021), and assuming court decisions all go against unitholders it would lead to an auction
of the interests, where after payment of what remains of the ARO the remaining balance of
the proceeds would go to unitholders. In this scenario time is our friend, particularly now
that oil has risen to around $100 per barrel. As of May 2022, the higher estimate of the
ARO remaining was $14.3 million and the balance was declining at about $1.5 million per
month. By the time of an auction it could be paid off or nearly so. With oil at $100 the
trust is generating roughly $4.5 million per quarter or $0.12 per unit. What would an
investor pay for the that? Assuming a conservative three-year payback for the buyer
comes to $1.50, and a 5x return for the fund from current prices. If the buyer assumes oil
averages $80 per barrel, then cash flow is $12 million per year, or $0.32 per unit, and a
three-year payback valuation comes to $1 per unit or 3x the current price.
2) Some kind of settlement where PCEC buys out unitholders or agrees to amortize the
ARO. A buyout would likely have a similar valuation of the worst case scenario. A
settlement about ARO treatment would result in the trust continuing in existence and unit
holders receiving monthly payments. With oil at $100, the trust would earn $0.12 per unit
per quarter. What is that worth in the (expert) market if the ARO issue is settled? We
think more than the worst case.
3) Bonanza – somehow the court finds PCEC acted inappropriately, or it finds that a major
portion of the ARO has already been assessed. We noted to the group filing suit that the
original prospectus noted that $22.3 million of ARO had already been accrued before the
trust was created.5 Thus we think it is possible, if not likely, that PCEC is charging
something that was already (partially) accrued for. If so, that is $0.66 per unit based on 38
million units outstanding. The value of the units could be near $2 or more.
The bottom line is we don’t know precisely what the units are worth, but our analysis
concluded that it is likely more than the current price. We made it a 4% position in the
fund. Hopefully we are not missing a key issue. Time will tell.
4 As best we can tell, the funds did not need to be segregated in a separate account. It may be that PCEC could use
the funds for other purposes while retaining the liability.

BM Technologies
In our third quarter 2021 letter we profiled BM Technologies (BMTX) a fintech company.
Almost immediately after we purchased the shares, the price jumped by 40%. We trimmed
the position. Soon after the price began declining. To refresh your memory, BMTX was
originally part of Customers Bancorp (CUBI). It was sold to Megalith Financial Acquisition
Corp., a SPAC. BMTX has developed a fintech banking platform which provides digital
banking and disbursement services to consumers and students in the United States. It
facilitates deposits and banking products and services between customers and partner
banks. The company provides access to a suite of banking products, including checking,
savings, personal loans, credit cards, and student refinancing. They are not a traditional
bank. It is a white label platform for other companies such as T-Mobile.
Approximately half of BMTX’s revenue is from payments by Customers Bancorp for roughly
$2 billion of deposits, and technically a sharing of the net interest margin Customers
expected to earn. (It looks like it was a sweetheart deal. The CEO of BMTX, Luvleen Sidhu,
is the daughter of the CEO of Customers, Jay Sidhu). Customers essentially has been
paying BMTX just over 2.75% for their deposits. Late in 2021 Customers informed BMTX
that it would not be continuing the relationship after the end of 2022. In a near zero
interest rate environment, BMTX had a problem. They were going to see earnings drop
precipitously in 2023 as it was highly unlikely they would receive nearly 3% for deposits.
Trailing adjusted EBITDA was $2.40 per share. If they only earned 1% on the deposits,
EBITDA would be breakeven or slightly negative.
BMTX’s solution was to purchase a small bank and bring the deposits in house. They
agreed to buy First Sound Bank (FSWA) for $25 million. The problem is the level of
deposits would far exceed the bank’s capital necessitating a large capital raise, which would
significantly dilute shareholders. At best net income would hold steady but the share count
would double or possibly triple, meaning earnings per share would decline by 1/2 to 1/3.
And that assumes they rapidly built up a lending team and loan portfolio, which does not
happen overnight.
Another issue also came up at the beginning of the year. BMTX had to restate their
financials due to how they treated some stock compensation. Previously the cost had been
borne by Customers Bancorp, but auditors decided BMTX should have amortized it over
calendar 2021 and 2022. BMTX made the adjustment, filed its annual report, and then
dismissed its auditors.
Just one of the major issues BMTX faced - needing a capital raise when you are seen as
desperate, are associated with a former SPAC, have had an accounting issue that led to
changing auditors, and being in the midst of a sharply declining market – would be a
challenge. Facing all was a perfect storm. Buyers were waiting for a bottom. Then
inflation kicked up, pushing interest rates up. BMTX went from the likelihood of having the
2.75% service revenue on its deposits declining to less than 1%, to potentially having no
drop at all. One-year CD rates are now 3% and have been trending higher. BMTX can
broker the deposits out to numerous banks and replace the relationship with Customers.
Today, they may be buying a bank they don’t actually need, but that is a much better
problem than what they faced six months ago.
The strange thing is that the market has not made an adjustment. The stock has
languished at $6 per share, which is just 2.5 times trailing adjusted EBITDA of $2.40 per
share. BMTX has no debt and we estimate end of June 2022 cash levels to be close to $35
million, or nearly $3 per share. While $25 million will go to buying First Sound, they will
still have a solid balance sheet. BMTX announced hiring KPMG as auditors this week, and
we expect them to be current in their filings by mid-September.

The risks are that rates decrease. Despite what the current administration says, we are
technically in a recession – two successive quarters of negative GDP. Are we likely to
return to zero interest rate policy? Probably not, but that does not mean rates won’t be
lower a year from now. The inverted yield curve also implies rates in the future will be
lower. Having spoken with BMTX’s CFO, we think BMTX has a proper understanding of the
situation and will act rationally. Our hope is that BMTX is able to stay a fintech company
and not turn completely into a bank that is subject to regulatory capital requirements. As a
fintech they can earn much higher returns on equity and will not need to keep all that
equity in the business.
For the moment, we think the current valuation of just over one times EBITDA, net of cash
is absurdly low. Assuming the bank purchase closes, the valuation is two times EBITDA net
of cash, plus the value of the bank. Barring a drastic change in the other parts of the
business, the downside scenario is the company functioning at breakeven. If that occurred
two years from now cash would equal the current value of the company. Thus, we think
the downside is very minimal, and the upside substantial. In addition, they are still
working on gaining additional white label partners, and were successful in the first quarter,
and deposits are still growing.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

The NASDAQ declined over 22% in the quarter and was down nearly 30% in the first six months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all down more than 10% in the quarter, and other than the DJIA, were down over 20% in the first half. Cedar Creek declined by 10.2% in the second quarter, net of fees and expenses, and was down 9.7% in the first six months, net of fees and expenses.1 While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen and a half year history is 13.4%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 688%, net of fees and expenses. Q2 ‘22 1H ‘22 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek -10.2% -9.7% 687.6% 13.4% NASDAQ -22.4% -29.5% 376.0% 9.9% DJIA (DIA) -10.8% -14.5% 310.8% 9.0% S&P 500 (SPY) -16.1% -20.0% 304.9% 8.9% Russell 2000 -17.2% -23.4% 200.6% 6.9% Russell Microcap -19.0% -25.1% 145.4% 5.6% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $787,576 as of June 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $245,365 in the Russell Micro Cap and $475,984 in the NASDAQ. 1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information). Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of June 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and under 5 times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.2. Dividend yield was 0.6%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was 18.9%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 14%. The big increase was primarily due to the settlement and sale of shares in Nocopi Technologies (NNUP) and new money coming in. On the buy side, late in the quarter we started building large positions in two microcap companies that we think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are trading at less than eight times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow in excess of 20% annually for the next ten years without the need for additional capital. Due to the low current price-to-earnings ratio, we think the average annual return for the two stocks will exceed their growth rate if the market re-rates the stocks to a higher P/E multiple. We expect to provide more detail in our Q3 or yearend letter, depending on when we are finished buying. If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the fund’s sixteen-year history, they are certainly in the top three! We are trying to steadily buy without pushing up the share prices, which is extremely difficult in microcaps. We purchased shares in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The attraction is the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern is the contract with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net cash balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share. Harbor earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted from funds from the payroll support program. They should be able to earn $0.60 per share before the expiration of the capacity agreement. The stock currently trades at round $2.20 per share. In addition, we increased our holdings in Western Capital Resources (WCRS) after it declined sharply due to their decision to go dark. Shares are currently under $5 per share. The company has $5.77 per share in net cash, and trailing earnings of $1.15 per share. The company repurchased shares last September at $7. It is 80% owned by Blackstreet and management. We expect the stock to end up on the expert tier or possibly not even trade at all. They did say they expect to make annual repurchase offers, but who knows what the valuation will be. Expert Market Exposure We continue to increase our exposure to shares trading in the expert market. These are companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We started the quarter with 19% exposure and ended at 22% of the fund. 2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate. We sold out of CCUR (CCUR) at a loss, and we received proceeds from the buyout of Adfitech (ADFT). We made roughly 70% on Adfitech in less than a year. Unfortunately, there was just never any liquidity to make it a meaningful position. Better a small gain than no gain. As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 23% of the fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 6% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is over 4%, as is Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG). We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter (link). Pacific Coast Oil Trust Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is an expert market stock. It is one of the more complicated and interesting stories we have come across. It is an oil and gas trust that was sold to the public in 2012 at $20 per unit. The trust gives unit holders the right to 80% of cashflow after the payment of production and development costs for oil fields located in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. At the time it went public the seller, Pacific Coast Energy Company (PCEC), formerly BreitBurn Energy, was retaining 52% of the trust units and selling 48% to the public.3 Fast forward a few years, oil prices had declined from $100 per barrel to $60 and production had declined from 3,400 barrels per day to 2,200 resulting in sharply lower distributions. By 2018 the trust was trading between $2 and $2.50 per unit and paying roughly $0.30 per unit annually. In September 2019 PCEC was acquired by NewBridge Resources. Just a few weeks later, in October 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the trust’s auditors resigned. In the 8-K filing on October 4, 2019 it stated, “PwC advised the Trust that information had come to PwC’s attention that causes PwC to be unwilling to be associated with the Trust’s financial statements in the future.” You don’t see that every day. The November 13, 2019 8-K notes that a 50% owner of NewBridge was or may have been affiliated with a company that filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Clearly there was more to the story. We have read unconfirmed reports that allege the buyers have criminal records that include embezzlement and insider trading. Talk about messy. Yet we aren’t actually done yet. That is only the who and the what, it is the how and the why that complete the picture. In the same November filing, PCEC notified the trust that PCEC intended to deduct future plugging and abandonment costs (also known as asset retirement obligations, or ARO) from the amounts otherwise payable to the Trust under its Net Profits Interest beginning January 2020. The amount of estimated cost was $56.7 million. Annual payout from the trust at the time was about $10-11 million. The costs were not expected to occur for a number of years. Some wells were expected to be exhausted within five years, while for other wells it would be thirty years or more into the future. The assessment would result in no payments to unit holders for a number of years, which would trigger a clause forcing sale of the trust. The trustee must have pushed back because PCEC commissioned Moss Adams to assist in determining the estimated asset retirement obligation (ARO). Moss Adams calculated it at $45.7 million, which was $11 million lower than before but would still trigger an eventual sale. The trust commissioned their own study by Martindale and came up with $28.7 million and communicated that the trust conveyance permits the amount to be accrued versus how PCEC wanted to treat it (all up front). It seems that the new owners of PCEC wanted to charge it up front knowing it would force sale of the trust in two years, and give PCEC all the cash flows in the interim.4 The trustee wanted to amortize the ARO over five years believing that was most equitable to unit holders, which was logical, but probably not consistent with GAAP (generally accepted accounted principles) which would require recognizing the present value of the liability immediately. The prospect of no further distributions sent the unit prices plummeting to 30 cents. No quarterly or annual filings were filed as there was no auditor. Unit holders did get monthly updates via press releases and 8-K filings from the trustee on production, revenues, expenses, operating income and the 80% net profit interest. Then COVID hit and oil plummeted from $60 per barrel to near $0 before resettling around $30 and slowly climbing back toward $60 by fall 2021. Due to COVID PCEC shut some production in. In July 2020 a unitholder filed suit. Unit prices fell to around 10 cents. Then it got even stranger. PCEC’s CEO who had the troubled past was ousted and supposedly blew the whistle in court. To make a long story a bit shorter. The court granted standing and prohibited dissolution of the trust. That eventually led to a three person arbitration panel that decided for PCEC, but that decision is still on hold pending settlement discussions. Units are currently trading around $0.32 per unit. So why did we buy units? We came to the conclusion that there were only a few likely outcomes: 1) Worst case – Unitholders have to pay full ARO and it leads to Dissolution of Trust. The two years of no payments by the trust has already occurred (from spring 2019 to spring 2021), and assuming court decisions all go against unitholders it would lead to an auction of the interests, where after payment of what remains of the ARO the remaining balance of the proceeds would go to unitholders. In this scenario time is our friend, particularly now that oil has risen to around $100 per barrel. As of May 2022, the higher estimate of the ARO remaining was $14.3 million and the balance was declining at about $1.5 million per month. By the time of an auction it could be paid off or nearly so. With oil at $100 the trust is generating roughly $4.5 million per quarter or $0.12 per unit. What would an investor pay for the that? Assuming a conservative three-year payback for the buyer comes to $1.50, and a 5x return for the fund from current prices. If the buyer assumes oil averages $80 per barrel, then cash flow is $12 million per year, or $0.32 per unit, and a three-year payback valuation comes to $1 per unit or 3x the current price. 2) Some kind of settlement where PCEC buys out unitholders or agrees to amortize the ARO. A buyout would likely have a similar valuation of the worst case scenario. A settlement about ARO treatment would result in the trust continuing in existence and unit holders receiving monthly payments. With oil at $100, the trust would earn $0.12 per unit per quarter. What is that worth in the (expert) market if the ARO issue is settled? We think more than the worst case. 3) Bonanza – somehow the court finds PCEC acted inappropriately, or it finds that a major portion of the ARO has already been assessed. We noted to the group filing suit that the original prospectus noted that $22.3 million of ARO had already been accrued before the trust was created.5 Thus we think it is possible, if not likely, that PCEC is charging something that was already (partially) accrued for. If so, that is $0.66 per unit based on 38 million units outstanding. The value of the units could be near $2 or more. The bottom line is we don’t know precisely what the units are worth, but our analysis concluded that it is likely more than the current price. We made it a 4% position in the fund. Hopefully we are not missing a key issue. Time will tell. 4 As best we can tell, the funds did not need to be segregated in a separate account. It may be that PCEC could use the funds for other purposes while retaining the liability. 5 See note 7 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001538822/000119312512212391/d273119d424b1.htm BM Technologies In our third quarter 2021 letter we profiled BM Technologies (BMTX) a fintech company. Almost immediately after we purchased the shares, the price jumped by 40%. We trimmed the position. Soon after the price began declining. To refresh your memory, BMTX was originally part of Customers Bancorp (CUBI). It was sold to Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp., a SPAC. BMTX has developed a fintech banking platform which provides digital banking and disbursement services to consumers and students in the United States. It facilitates deposits and banking products and services between customers and partner banks. The company provides access to a suite of banking products, including checking, savings, personal loans, credit cards, and student refinancing. They are not a traditional bank. It is a white label platform for other companies such as T-Mobile. Approximately half of BMTX’s revenue is from payments by Customers Bancorp for roughly $2 billion of deposits, and technically a sharing of the net interest margin Customers expected to earn. (It looks like it was a sweetheart deal. The CEO of BMTX, Luvleen Sidhu, is the daughter of the CEO of Customers, Jay Sidhu). Customers essentially has been paying BMTX just over 2.75% for their deposits. Late in 2021 Customers informed BMTX that it would not be continuing the relationship after the end of 2022. In a near zero interest rate environment, BMTX had a problem. They were going to see earnings drop precipitously in 2023 as it was highly unlikely they would receive nearly 3% for deposits. Trailing adjusted EBITDA was $2.40 per share. If they only earned 1% on the deposits, EBITDA would be breakeven or slightly negative. BMTX’s solution was to purchase a small bank and bring the deposits in house. They agreed to buy First Sound Bank (FSWA) for $25 million. The problem is the level of deposits would far exceed the bank’s capital necessitating a large capital raise, which would significantly dilute shareholders. At best net income would hold steady but the share count would double or possibly triple, meaning earnings per share would decline by 1/2 to 1/3. And that assumes they rapidly built up a lending team and loan portfolio, which does not happen overnight. Another issue also came up at the beginning of the year. BMTX had to restate their financials due to how they treated some stock compensation. Previously the cost had been borne by Customers Bancorp, but auditors decided BMTX should have amortized it over calendar 2021 and 2022. BMTX made the adjustment, filed its annual report, and then dismissed its auditors. Just one of the major issues BMTX faced - needing a capital raise when you are seen as desperate, are associated with a former SPAC, have had an accounting issue that led to changing auditors, and being in the midst of a sharply declining market – would be a challenge. Facing all was a perfect storm. Buyers were waiting for a bottom. Then inflation kicked up, pushing interest rates up. BMTX went from the likelihood of having the 2.75% service revenue on its deposits declining to less than 1%, to potentially having no drop at all. One-year CD rates are now 3% and have been trending higher. BMTX can broker the deposits out to numerous banks and replace the relationship with Customers. Today, they may be buying a bank they don’t actually need, but that is a much better problem than what they faced six months ago. The strange thing is that the market has not made an adjustment. The stock has languished at $6 per share, which is just 2.5 times trailing adjusted EBITDA of $2.40 per share. BMTX has no debt and we estimate end of June 2022 cash levels to be close to $35 million, or nearly $3 per share. While $25 million will go to buying First Sound, they will still have a solid balance sheet. BMTX announced hiring KPMG as auditors this week, and we expect them to be current in their filings by mid-September. The risks are that rates decrease. Despite what the current administration says, we are technically in a recession – two successive quarters of negative GDP. Are we likely to return to zero interest rate policy? Probably not, but that does not mean rates won’t be lower a year from now. The inverted yield curve also implies rates in the future will be lower. Having spoken with BMTX’s CFO, we think BMTX has a proper understanding of the situation and will act rationally. Our hope is that BMTX is able to stay a fintech company and not turn completely into a bank that is subject to regulatory capital requirements. As a fintech they can earn much higher returns on equity and will not need to keep all that equity in the business. For the moment, we think the current valuation of just over one times EBITDA, net of cash is absurdly low. Assuming the bank purchase closes, the valuation is two times EBITDA net of cash, plus the value of the bank. Barring a drastic change in the other parts of the business, the downside scenario is the company functioning at breakeven. If that occurred two years from now cash would equal the current value of the company. Thus, we think the downside is very minimal, and the upside substantial. In addition, they are still working on gaining additional white label partners, and were successful in the first quarter, and deposits are still growing. Room for New Members and/or Additional Funds We continue to have more attractive ideas than capital. Thus, there is plenty of room for existing partners to increase their investment and for others to join. Please consider referring friends of yours who may be potential new investors. The basic requirements are 1) that each invests a minimum of $100,000 and 2) that new members are accredited (high net worth) individuals. Subsequent investments must be for a minimum of $10,000.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 Second Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
Near double digit inflation and increasing interest rates led to a large market decline in the
second quarter. The NASDAQ declined over 22% in the quarter and was down nearly 30%
in the first six months of the year. The other major indices we compare against were all
down more than 10% in the quarter, and other than the DJIA, were down over 20% in the
first half. Cedar Creek declined by 10.2% in the second quarter, net of fees and expenses,
and was down 9.7% in the first six months, net of fees and expenses.1
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on microcap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen and a half year history is 13.4%, net
of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against.
Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 688%, net of fees and expenses.
Q2 ‘22 1H ‘22 Inception Ave. Annual
Cedar Creek -10.2% -9.7% 687.6% 13.4%
NASDAQ -22.4% -29.5% 376.0% 9.9%
DJIA (DIA) -10.8% -14.5% 310.8% 9.0%
S&P 500 (SPY) -16.1% -20.0% 304.9% 8.9%
Russell 2000 -17.2% -23.4% 200.6% 6.9%
Russell Microcap -19.0% -25.1% 145.4% 5.6%
* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $787,576
as of June 30, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes
we compare against would have only grown to between $245,365 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $475,984 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of June 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less
than 7 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and under 5 times
earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book was 1.2.
Dividend yield was 0.6%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was 18.9%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at 5% and ended the quarter at 14%. The big
increase was primarily due to the settlement and sale of shares in Nocopi Technologies
(NNUP) and new money coming in.
On the buy side, late in the quarter we started building large positions in two microcap
companies that we think have the potential to be significant compounders. Both are
trading at less than eight times trailing earnings, and we expect earnings to grow in excess
of 20% annually for the next ten years without the need for additional capital. Due to the
low current price-to-earnings ratio, we think the average annual return for the two stocks
will exceed their growth rate if the market re-rates the stocks to a higher P/E multiple. We
expect to provide more detail in our Q3 or yearend letter, depending on when we are
finished buying. If they are not the most attractive investments we have made in the
fund’s sixteen-year history, they are certainly in the top three! We are trying to steadily
buy without pushing up the share prices, which is extremely difficult in microcaps.
We purchased shares in Harbor Diversified (HRBR) during the quarter. Harbor is the
holding company for Wisconsin Airlines, which has a capacity agreement with United. The
attraction is the high cash balance and current profitability. The concern is the contract
with United ends in 2023. Our purchases were at prices below the company’s net cash
balances of $2.24 per share, and at less than 70% of book value per diluted share. Harbor
earned $0.14 per share in Q1 and $0.15 in Q4 of 2021. Neither quarter benefitted from
funds from the payroll support program. They should be able to earn $0.60 per share
before the expiration of the capacity agreement. The stock currently trades at round $2.20
per share.
In addition, we increased our holdings in Western Capital Resources (WCRS) after it
declined sharply due to their decision to go dark. Shares are currently under $5 per share.
The company has $5.77 per share in net cash, and trailing earnings of $1.15 per share.
The company repurchased shares last September at $7. It is 80% owned by Blackstreet
and management. We expect the stock to end up on the expert tier or possibly not even
trade at all. They did say they expect to make annual repurchase offers, but who knows
what the valuation will be.
Expert Market Exposure
We continue to increase our exposure to shares trading in the expert market. These are
companies impacted by SEC Rule 15c2-11. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers
from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions
to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the
buying restriction. We started the quarter with 19% exposure and ended at 22% of the
fund.
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

We sold out of CCUR (CCUR) at a loss, and we received proceeds from the buyout of
Adfitech (ADFT). We made roughly 70% on Adfitech in less than a year. Unfortunately,
there was just never any liquidity to make it a meaningful position. Better a small gain
than no gain.
As noted above, our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 23% of the
fund’s assets. Three positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is almost 6% of the fund, Pacific Coast Oil Trust
(ROYTL) is over 4%, as is Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG). We discussed PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021
letter (link).
Pacific Coast Oil Trust
Pacific Coast Oil Trust (ROYTL) is an expert market stock. It is one of the more complicated
and interesting stories we have come across. It is an oil and gas trust that was sold to the
public in 2012 at $20 per unit. The trust gives unit holders the right to 80% of cashflow
after the payment of production and development costs for oil fields located in Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara counties. At the time it went public the seller, Pacific Coast Energy
Company (PCEC), formerly BreitBurn Energy, was retaining 52% of the trust units and
selling 48% to the public.3
Fast forward a few years, oil prices had declined from $100 per barrel to $60 and
production had declined from 3,400 barrels per day to 2,200 resulting in sharply lower
distributions. By 2018 the trust was trading between $2 and $2.50 per unit and paying
roughly $0.30 per unit annually. In September 2019 PCEC was acquired by NewBridge
Resources. Just a few weeks later, in October 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the
trust’s auditors resigned. In the 8-K filing on October 4, 2019 it stated, “PwC advised the
Trust that information had come to PwC’s attention that causes PwC to be unwilling to be
associated with the Trust’s financial statements in the future.” You don’t see that every
day. The November 13, 2019 8-K notes that a 50% owner of NewBridge was or may have
been affiliated with a company that filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Clearly there was more to
the story. We have read unconfirmed reports that allege the buyers have criminal records
that include embezzlement and insider trading. Talk about messy. Yet we aren’t actually
done yet. That is only the who and the what, it is the how and the why that complete the
picture.
In the same November filing, PCEC notified the trust that PCEC intended to deduct future
plugging and abandonment costs (also known as asset retirement obligations, or ARO) from
the amounts otherwise payable to the Trust under its Net Profits Interest beginning January
2020. The amount of estimated cost was $56.7 million. Annual payout from the trust at
the time was about $10-11 million. The costs were not expected to occur for a number of
years. Some wells were expected to be exhausted within five years, while for other wells it
would be thirty years or more into the future. The assessment would result in no payments
to unit holders for a number of years, which would trigger a clause forcing sale of the trust.
The trustee must have pushed back because PCEC commissioned Moss Adams to assist in
determining the estimated asset retirement obligation (ARO). Moss Adams calculated it at
$45.7 million, which was $11 million lower than before but would still trigger an eventual
sale. The trust commissioned their own study by Martindale and came up with $28.7
million and communicated that the trust conveyance permits the amount to be accrued
versus how PCEC wanted to treat it (all up front). It seems that the new owners of PCEC
3 In 2013 PCEC sold 85% of the remaining units it held in a secondary offering at $17, and then in June 2014 sold
the remaining units at $13.

wanted to charge it up front knowing it would force sale of the trust in two years, and give
PCEC all the cash flows in the interim.4 The trustee wanted to amortize the ARO over five
years believing that was most equitable to unit holders, which was logical, but probably not
consistent with GAAP (generally accepted accounted principles) which would require
recognizing the present value of the liability immediately.
The prospect of no further distributions sent the unit prices plummeting to 30 cents. No
quarterly or annual filings were filed as there was no auditor. Unit holders did get monthly
updates via press releases and 8-K filings from the trustee on production, revenues,
expenses, operating income and the 80% net profit interest. Then COVID hit and oil
plummeted from $60 per barrel to near $0 before resettling around $30 and slowly climbing
back toward $60 by fall 2021. Due to COVID PCEC shut some production in. In July 2020
a unitholder filed suit. Unit prices fell to around 10 cents. Then it got even stranger.
PCEC’s CEO who had the troubled past was ousted and supposedly blew the whistle in
court. To make a long story a bit shorter. The court granted standing and prohibited
dissolution of the trust. That eventually led to a three person arbitration panel that decided
for PCEC, but that decision is still on hold pending settlement discussions.
Units are currently trading around $0.32 per unit. So why did we buy units? We came to
the conclusion that there were only a few likely outcomes:
1) Worst case – Unitholders have to pay full ARO and it leads to Dissolution of Trust. The
two years of no payments by the trust has already occurred (from spring 2019 to spring
2021), and assuming court decisions all go against unitholders it would lead to an auction
of the interests, where after payment of what remains of the ARO the remaining balance of
the proceeds would go to unitholders. In this scenario time is our friend, particularly now
that oil has risen to around $100 per barrel. As of May 2022, the higher estimate of the
ARO remaining was $14.3 million and the balance was declining at about $1.5 million per
month. By the time of an auction it could be paid off or nearly so. With oil at $100 the
trust is generating roughly $4.5 million per quarter or $0.12 per unit. What would an
investor pay for the that? Assuming a conservative three-year payback for the buyer
comes to $1.50, and a 5x return for the fund from current prices. If the buyer assumes oil
averages $80 per barrel, then cash flow is $12 million per year, or $0.32 per unit, and a
three-year payback valuation comes to $1 per unit or 3x the current price.
2) Some kind of settlement where PCEC buys out unitholders or agrees to amortize the
ARO. A buyout would likely have a similar valuation of the worst case scenario. A
settlement about ARO treatment would result in the trust continuing in existence and unit
holders receiving monthly payments. With oil at $100, the trust would earn $0.12 per unit
per quarter. What is that worth in the (expert) market if the ARO issue is settled? We
think more than the worst case.
3) Bonanza – somehow the court finds PCEC acted inappropriately, or it finds that a major
portion of the ARO has already been assessed. We noted to the group filing suit that the
original prospectus noted that $22.3 million of ARO had already been accrued before the
trust was created.5 Thus we think it is possible, if not likely, that PCEC is charging
something that was already (partially) accrued for. If so, that is $0.66 per unit based on 38
million units outstanding. The value of the units could be near $2 or more.
The bottom line is we don’t know precisely what the units are worth, but our analysis
concluded that it is likely more than the current price. We made it a 4% position in the
fund. Hopefully we are not missing a key issue. Time will tell.
4 As best we can tell, the funds did not need to be segregated in a separate account. It may be that PCEC could use
the funds for other purposes while retaining the liability.

BM Technologies
In our third quarter 2021 letter we profiled BM Technologies (BMTX) a fintech company.
Almost immediately after we purchased the shares, the price jumped by 40%. We trimmed
the position. Soon after the price began declining. To refresh your memory, BMTX was
originally part of Customers Bancorp (CUBI). It was sold to Megalith Financial Acquisition
Corp., a SPAC. BMTX has developed a fintech banking platform which provides digital
banking and disbursement services to consumers and students in the United States. It
facilitates deposits and banking products and services between customers and partner
banks. The company provides access to a suite of banking products, including checking,
savings, personal loans, credit cards, and student refinancing. They are not a traditional
bank. It is a white label platform for other companies such as T-Mobile.
Approximately half of BMTX’s revenue is from payments by Customers Bancorp for roughly
$2 billion of deposits, and technically a sharing of the net interest margin Customers
expected to earn. (It looks like it was a sweetheart deal. The CEO of BMTX, Luvleen Sidhu,
is the daughter of the CEO of Customers, Jay Sidhu). Customers essentially has been
paying BMTX just over 2.75% for their deposits. Late in 2021 Customers informed BMTX
that it would not be continuing the relationship after the end of 2022. In a near zero
interest rate environment, BMTX had a problem. They were going to see earnings drop
precipitously in 2023 as it was highly unlikely they would receive nearly 3% for deposits.
Trailing adjusted EBITDA was $2.40 per share. If they only earned 1% on the deposits,
EBITDA would be breakeven or slightly negative.
BMTX’s solution was to purchase a small bank and bring the deposits in house. They
agreed to buy First Sound Bank (FSWA) for $25 million. The problem is the level of
deposits would far exceed the bank’s capital necessitating a large capital raise, which would
significantly dilute shareholders. At best net income would hold steady but the share count
would double or possibly triple, meaning earnings per share would decline by 1/2 to 1/3.
And that assumes they rapidly built up a lending team and loan portfolio, which does not
happen overnight.
Another issue also came up at the beginning of the year. BMTX had to restate their
financials due to how they treated some stock compensation. Previously the cost had been
borne by Customers Bancorp, but auditors decided BMTX should have amortized it over
calendar 2021 and 2022. BMTX made the adjustment, filed its annual report, and then
dismissed its auditors.
Just one of the major issues BMTX faced - needing a capital raise when you are seen as
desperate, are associated with a former SPAC, have had an accounting issue that led to
changing auditors, and being in the midst of a sharply declining market – would be a
challenge. Facing all was a perfect storm. Buyers were waiting for a bottom. Then
inflation kicked up, pushing interest rates up. BMTX went from the likelihood of having the
2.75% service revenue on its deposits declining to less than 1%, to potentially having no
drop at all. One-year CD rates are now 3% and have been trending higher. BMTX can
broker the deposits out to numerous banks and replace the relationship with Customers.
Today, they may be buying a bank they don’t actually need, but that is a much better
problem than what they faced six months ago.
The strange thing is that the market has not made an adjustment. The stock has
languished at $6 per share, which is just 2.5 times trailing adjusted EBITDA of $2.40 per
share. BMTX has no debt and we estimate end of June 2022 cash levels to be close to $35
million, or nearly $3 per share. While $25 million will go to buying First Sound, they will
still have a solid balance sheet. BMTX announced hiring KPMG as auditors this week, and
we expect them to be current in their filings by mid-September.

The risks are that rates decrease. Despite what the current administration says, we are
technically in a recession – two successive quarters of negative GDP. Are we likely to
return to zero interest rate policy? Probably not, but that does not mean rates won’t be
lower a year from now. The inverted yield curve also implies rates in the future will be
lower. Having spoken with BMTX’s CFO, we think BMTX has a proper understanding of the
situation and will act rationally. Our hope is that BMTX is able to stay a fintech company
and not turn completely into a bank that is subject to regulatory capital requirements. As a
fintech they can earn much higher returns on equity and will not need to keep all that
equity in the business.
For the moment, we think the current valuation of just over one times EBITDA, net of cash
is absurdly low. Assuming the bank purchase closes, the valuation is two times EBITDA net
of cash, plus the value of the bank. Barring a drastic change in the other parts of the
business, the downside scenario is the company functioning at breakeven. If that occurred
two years from now cash would equal the current value of the company. Thus, we think
the downside is very minimal, and the upside substantial. In addition, they are still
working on gaining additional white label partners, and were successful in the first quarter,
and deposits are still growing.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Inflation is rising quickly - likely connected to a combination of the Fed’s extended zero interest rate policy, massive fiscal stimulus during Covid, and supply chain issues mainly due to Covid. As measured by the S&P 500, the market has only had one negative year since 2008. 12 out of 13 positive years, with the one down year being only 4.6% is quite a run. Cedar Creek held during the first quarter and managed to end the quarter up by 0.5%, net of fees and expenses. Of the major indices we compare against, the Dow Jones Industrial Average performed the best, declining by 4.1% in the quarter. The Russell 2000 was the laggard, declining by 7.5%. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on micro cap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen year history is 14.3%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 776%, net of fees and expenses. Q1 ‘22 2021 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 0.5% 38.9% 776.3% 14.3% NASDAQ -9.1% 21.4% 513.7% 11.8% S&P 500 (SPY) -4.6% 28.6% 382.6% 10.2% DJIA (DIA) -4.1% 20.8% 360.6% 9.9% Russell 2000 -7.5% 14.8% 263.1% 8.3% Russell Micro Cap -7.6% 19.3% 202.8% 7.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $876,307 as of March 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $302,762 in the Russell Micro Cap and $613,736 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of March 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 10 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and just 6.5 times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Weighted price to book was 1.4. Dividend yield was 0.3%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was 14.7%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at just under 18% and ended the quarter at 5%. We closed out a few minor positions such as Hennessy Advisors (HNNA) and Colicity (COLIU). On the buy side we added a number of smaller positions. Many of these are shown in our “basket of deplorables” described later in the letter. We also funded a non-public investment. Tix Corporation, a company we previously owned shares in, fell upon hard times during COVID and filed for bankruptcy. Tix, which sells show tickets in Las Vegas, re-opened last fall with three locations on the strip. We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a private investor to bid on the company and won the auction. Or maybe we should say we were high bidder. We won’t know if we truly won for a while. The investment was less than ten percent of the fund’s assets. The business, excluding legal costs related to the transaction, has operated profitably since our purchase at the end of February. Rents along the strip are extremely high which results in significant operating leverage. Once fixed costs are covered incremental margins are very attractive. It is too early to know if the business will get back to pre-covid levels or how much competition we will face. A new competitor entered the market in the last few weeks. Shows are still in the process of re-opening so we are cautiously optimistic about the future. Expert Market Exposure We mentioned last quarter that we had increased cash levels hoping to take advantage of the effects of Rule 15c2-11 on some illiquid names. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We continue to make smaller purchases of “expert market” stocks and are on the prowl for more. We hope to build a basket of smaller positions. We are not going to mention names at this point. w us to continue to take advantage of what is in our view an idiotic rule. Our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 19% of the fund’s assets. Four positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is 4% of the fund, CCUR (CCUR) which is about 3%, and Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG) which is just under 3% of the fund. We are building a position in a fourth, that is currently just over 3%, and look forward to describing it in more detail. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter (link). Our “Basket of Deplorables” Not to get political, but we find the name humorous. We are using it in a mixed way – many of the stocks have management, or capital allocation, that is deplorable. Yet in our opinion, the price more than reflects that reality, such that the stocks are not actually deplorable. (We know if you have to explain the “joke,” it is not really humorous…). Anyways, below are holdings in the fund that are unloved by the market. They share many similarities. As the majority owner column shows they tend to have a controlling owner. They nearly all are trading at a discount to book value and have significant cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Nearly all are illiquid.

Our projections. * Steven Kiel/Arquitos owns 28.5%. Proposed merger will make David Sherman the majority owner Our preference is for securities that are growing yet are priced like they are not. They are rare. Most high growth stocks are priced for perfection, and due to a high valuation are not attractive to us. That tends to leave us sifting through lower growth stocks that are for various reasons unloved, and no-growth stocks that are selling for less than what we think the business or assets are worth. The above basket is primarily no-growth stocks and most are valued based on their high quality assets (cash and securities). We have to be patient when buying and selling the no growth asset stocks, and avoid becoming too greedy. In other words, in order to make money we try to buy when we think they are ridiculously cheap and try to sell at a more modest discount to a fair price. A few do not have operating businesses and any growth will only reflect portfolio performance, such as Initio (INTO) or Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Co. (PAWH), or an eventual acquisition, such as Rubicon Technology (RBCN)). A few have nice little businesses such as Spindletop (SPND), Reserve Petroleum (RSRV), and Western Capital Resources (WCRS) where we get decent exposure to the business while retaining substantial downside protection due to their balance sheets. Others have decent businesses but are hiding in the dark, like Dyna Group (DGIX). The company does not want to report publicly and due to the presence of a controlling owner there is little we can do about it. Every now and then we can buy shares at less than cash and believe that over time we will earn a decent return. Queen City Investments – Royally Bad Capital Allocation One of the names on the list is Queen City Investments (QUCT). It was spun off from Farmers & Merchants Bank of Long Beach (FMBL) in 1973. FMBL itself was founded in 1907 by C.J. Walker and as far as we know, has been controlled by the Walker family ever since. It is a conservatively run bank. Total assets are nearly $11.7 billion. The bank has always had a very conservative balance sheet. Historically it has kept nearly half of the assets on its balance sheet in government securities. Equity to assets was in the 20% range for decades, which is more than twice what the typical bank kept. Despite the drag of lower earning securities, and excess equity, the bank still managed to earn just under double digit returns on equity. Its earnings are due to a low cost deposit base. In other words, Queen City has a very conservative parent, and it shows. Queen City has 47,739 shares outstanding with a last trade of $1,300 per share. It is described as an investment company. It initially held securities in FMBL and a 27,000 acre cattle ranch in Arroyo Grande, California (Central coast, inland from Pismo Beach, near San Luis Obispo). We are not sure when it occurred, but it no longer owns shares in FMBL. Today, it really is a trust company. As of the end of 2021 it managed $6.17 billion in assets for 1,391 trust accounts, a solid increase from the $4.34 billion in assets for 1,304 accounts at the end of 2020. In addition to the ranch, it owns some real estate, including one of FMBL’s branches. Queen City also owns a large pile of treasury bills. Roughly $29 million, or over $600 per share of QUCT. That is the problem. The trust business is fabulous, with a return on equity of approximately 90%. What QUCT’s management has done is paired this fabulous, capital light, high ROE business with a portfolio of t-bills – an asset that is the opposite – poor performing, capital intensive, miniscule ROE “business.” The end result is that all the earnings of the fabulous business are being reinvested at 1.5%, a rate that not only historically very low, but is now well below inflation. To put it another way, every dollar they retain is worth less a year later. (See the next page for our segment analysis). There is absolutely no reason that we can think of for QUCT to do this. It does not relate the trust business. The annual report notes that the pledged assets to ensure faithful performance of fiduciary duties is less than $1 million. We should also point out, the same poor capital allocation applies to it owning a 27,000 cattle ranch that appears marginally profitable, yet could likely be sold for more than $20 million. Management even borrowed $4 million for a real estate investment at prime (3.25%), which is a great rate, but really makes no sense while perpetually sitting on nearly $30 million of lower yielding treasury bills. Some may ask, why own it then? Fair question. Last summer, after nearly fifteen years of a stagnant share price, and twenty five years with no dividend increase, we believed that shares at just over $1,000 were an attractive low-risk opportunity. We knew cash and securities were roughly $700 per share and that the business was earning in excess of $80 per share. In other words, we were paying less than four times earnings net of cash, which was attributing nothing to the 27,000 acre ranch. With 47,739 shares, each share “owns” 0.57 acres. If the ranch at the time of our purchase was only worth $14 million, or $300 per share, we were getting the trust business for “free” ($700 per share of t-bills and $300+ per share for the ranch). We haven’t even delved into the rental properties. Our segment analysis shows the rental properties as earning $900,000 and that is after accounting for $754,000 of depreciation. Rental properties are typically valued on FFO (funds from operations) which is basically cash flow or net income plus depreciation. Assuming a 15x multiple, the $1.65 million in cash flows would be worth around $25 million, or nearly $520 per share. Note 5 of the annual report notes a basis of $25.5 million, so we think we are being conservative. Based on a sum of the parts analysis, which admittedly can be dangerous, the non trust company segments are conservatively worth $1,400 per share. We are up 25-30% since we purchased last year and know if QUCT management ever got serious about creating shareholder value we could do significantly better. Even if it doesn’t happen soon, we think eventually family members, who are shareholders, will catch on over time, and push for change. It seems doubtful the trust business would ever be sold due to its connections to the bank, but the other three segments are not essential. One last point on the trust business that got our attention was that revenue rose $1.1 million in 2021 versus 2020 while personnel compensation declined by $10,000. The prior year, revenue had risen by nearly $700,000 and personnel costs had only risen by $40,000. That is excellent operating leverage, and important since sometimes the profits from these kinds of securities are siphoned off via salaries. We would propose that Queen City liquidate most of the treasury bills and either pay a $500 per share special dividend or allocate the $500 per share to a tender offer, which would allow them to reduce shares by up to one-third. Either would show that management is serious about capital allocation and would improve shareholders view of the company. After that they could look at either selling the ranch or spinning it off, possibly with the real estate. Lastly, with the trust business not needing additional capital, Queen City could increase the dividend to a more meaningful percentage of net income. Queen City Investments Inc.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
In hindsight it is not surprising that the markets are down this year. Inflation is rising
quickly - likely connected to a combination of the Fed’s extended zero interest rate policy,
massive fiscal stimulus during Covid, and supply chain issues mainly due to Covid. As
measured by the S&P 500, the market has only had one negative year since 2008. 12 out
of 13 positive years, with the one down year being only 4.6% is quite a run. Cedar Creek
held during the first quarter and managed to end the quarter up by 0.5%, net of fees and
expenses.1 Of the major indices we compare against, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
performed the best, declining by 4.1% in the quarter. The Russell 2000 was the laggard,
declining by 7.5%.
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on micro cap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen year history is 14.3%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 776%, net of fees and expenses.

* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $876,307
as of March 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes
we compare against would have only grown to between $302,762 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $613,736 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at
less than 10 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and just 6.5
times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book
was 1.4. Dividend yield was 0.3%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was
14.7%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at just under 18% and ended the quarter at 5%.
We closed out a few minor positions such as Hennessy Advisors (HNNA) and Colicity
(COLIU).
On the buy side we added a number of smaller positions. Many of these are shown in our
“basket of deplorables” described later in the letter. We also funded a non-public
investment. Tix Corporation, a company we previously owned shares in, fell upon hard
times during COVID and filed for bankruptcy. Tix, which sells show tickets in Las Vegas, re-
opened last fall with three locations on the strip. We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera
Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a private investor to bid on the company and
won the auction. Or maybe we should say we were high bidder. We won’t know if we truly
won for a while. The investment was less than ten percent of the fund’s assets.
The business, excluding legal costs related to the transaction, has operated profitably since
our purchase at the end of February. Rents along the strip are extremely high which
results in significant operating leverage. Once fixed costs are covered incremental margins
are very attractive. It is too early to know if the business will get back to pre-covid levels
or how much competition we will face. A new competitor entered the market in the last few
weeks. Shows are still in the process of re-opening so we are cautiously optimistic about
the future.
Expert Market Exposure
We mentioned last quarter that we had increased cash levels hoping to take advantage of
the effects of Rule 15c2-11 on some illiquid names. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents
brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts
transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
We continue to make smaller purchases of “expert market” stocks and are on the prowl for
more. We hope to build a basket of smaller positions. We are not going to mention names
at this point. w us to continue to take advantage of what is in our view an idiotic rule.
Our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 19% of the fund’s assets.
Four positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX)
which is 4% of the fund, CCUR (CCUR) which is about 3%, and Mortgage Oil Company
(MGAG) which is just under 3% of the fund. We are building a position in a fourth, that is
currently just over 3%, and look forward to describing it in more detail. We discussed PD-
Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2
2021 letter (link).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

Our “Basket of Deplorables”
Not to get political, but we find the name humorous. We are using it in a mixed way –
many of the stocks have management, or capital allocation, that is deplorable. Yet in our
opinion, the price more than reflects that reality, such that the stocks are not actually
deplorable. (We know if you have to explain the “joke,” it is not really humorous…).
Anyways, below are holdings in the fund that are unloved by the market. They share many
similarities. As the majority owner column shows they tend to have a controlling owner.
They nearly all are trading at a discount to book value and have significant cash and
marketable securities on the balance sheet. Nearly all are illiquid. We use the term basket
since none are individually a large component of the fund aside from PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX).

Our preference is for securities that are growing yet are priced like they are not. They are
rare. Most high growth stocks are priced for perfection, and due to a high valuation are not
attractive to us. That tends to leave us sifting through lower growth stocks that are for
various reasons unloved, and no-growth stocks that are selling for less than what we think
the business or assets are worth. The above basket is primarily no-growth stocks and most
are valued based on their high quality assets (cash and securities). We have to be patient
when buying and selling the no growth asset stocks, and avoid becoming too greedy. In
other words, in order to make money we try to buy when we think they are ridiculously
cheap and try to sell at a more modest discount to a fair price.
A few do not have operating businesses and any growth will only reflect portfolio
performance, such as Initio (INTO) or Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit
Co. (PAWH), or an eventual acquisition, such as Rubicon Technology (RBCN)). A few
have nice little businesses such as Spindletop (SPND), Reserve Petroleum (RSRV), and
Western Capital Resources (WCRS) where we get decent exposure to the business while
retaining substantial downside protection due to their balance sheets. Others have decent
businesses but are hiding in the dark, like Dyna Group (DGIX). The company does not
want to report publicly and due to the presence of a controlling owner there is little we can
do about it. Every now and then we can buy shares at less than cash and believe that over
time we will earn a decent return.

Queen City Investments – Royally Bad Capital Allocation
One of the names on the list is Queen City Investments (QUCT). It was spun off from
Farmers & Merchants Bank of Long Beach (FMBL) in 1973. FMBL itself was founded in
1907 by C.J. Walker and as far as we know, has been controlled by the Walker family ever
since. It is a conservatively run bank. Total assets are nearly $11.7 billion. The bank has
always had a very conservative balance sheet. Historically it has kept nearly half of the
assets on its balance sheet in government securities. Equity to assets was in the 20%
range for decades, which is more than twice what the typical bank kept. Despite the drag
of lower earning securities, and excess equity, the bank still managed to earn just under
double digit returns on equity. Its earnings are due to a low cost deposit base. In other
words, Queen City has a very conservative parent, and it shows.
Queen City has 47,739 shares outstanding with a last trade of $1,300 per share. It is
described as an investment company. It initially held securities in FMBL and a 27,000 acre
cattle ranch in Arroyo Grande, California (Central coast, inland from Pismo Beach, near San
Luis Obispo). We are not sure when it occurred, but it no longer owns shares in FMBL.
Today, it really is a trust company. As of the end of 2021 it managed $6.17 billion in assets
for 1,391 trust accounts, a solid increase from the $4.34 billion in assets for 1,304 accounts
at the end of 2020. In addition to the ranch, it owns some real estate, including one of
FMBL’s branches.
Queen City also owns a large pile of treasury bills. Roughly $29 million, or over $600 per
share of QUCT. That is the problem. The trust business is fabulous, with a return on equity
of approximately 90%. What QUCT’s management has done is paired this fabulous, capital
light, high ROE business with a portfolio of t-bills – an asset that is the opposite – poor
performing, capital intensive, miniscule ROE “business.” The end result is that all the
earnings of the fabulous business are being reinvested at 1.5%, a rate that not only
historically very low, but is now well below inflation. To put it another way, every dollar
they retain is worth less a year later. (See the next page for our segment analysis).
There is absolutely no reason that we can think of for QUCT to do this. It does not relate
the trust business. The annual report notes that the pledged assets to ensure faithful
performance of fiduciary duties is less than $1 million. We should also point out, the same
poor capital allocation applies to it owning a 27,000 cattle ranch that appears marginally
profitable, yet could likely be sold for more than $20 million. Management even borrowed
$4 million for a real estate investment at prime (3.25%), which is a great rate, but really
makes no sense while perpetually sitting on nearly $30 million of lower yielding treasury
bills.
Some may ask, why own it then? Fair question. Last summer, after nearly fifteen years of
a stagnant share price, and twenty five years with no dividend increase, we believed that
shares at just over $1,000 were an attractive low-risk opportunity. We knew cash and
securities were roughly $700 per share and that the business was earning in excess of $80

per share, we were getting the trust business for “free” ($700 per share of t-bills and
$300+ per share for the ranch).
We haven’t even delved into the rental properties. Our segment analysis shows the rental
properties as earning $900,000 and that is after accounting for $754,000 of depreciation.
Rental properties are typically valued on FFO (funds from operations) which is basically
cash flow or net income plus depreciation. Assuming a 15x multiple, the $1.65 million in

cash flows would be worth around $25 million, or nearly $520 per share. Note 5 of the
annual report notes a basis of $25.5 million, so we think we are being conservative. Based
on a sum of the parts analysis, which admittedly can be dangerous, the non trust company
segments are conservatively worth $1,400 per share. We are up 25-30% since we
purchased last year and know if QUCT management ever got serious about creating
shareholder value we could do significantly better.
Even if it doesn’t happen soon, we think eventually family members, who are shareholders,
will catch on over time, and push for change. It seems doubtful the trust business would
ever be sold due to its connections to the bank, but the other three segments are not

$1.1 million in 2021 versus 2020 while personnel compensation declined by $10,000. The
prior year, revenue had risen by nearly $700,000 and personnel costs had only risen by
$40,000. That is excellent operating leverage, and important since sometimes the profits
from these kinds of securities are siphoned off via salaries.
We would propose that Queen City liquidate most of the treasury bills and either pay a
$500 per share special dividend or allocate the $500 per share to a tender offer, which
would allow them to reduce shares by up to one-third. Either would show that
management is serious about capital allocation and would improve shareholders view of the
company. After that they could look at either selling the ranch or spinning it off, possibly
with the real estate. Lastly, with the trust business not needing additional capital, Queen
City could increase the dividend to a more meaningful percentage of net income.

DISCLAIMERS
Fund Performance
The financial performance figures for 2022 presented in this report are un-audited estimates based on
the best information available at the time of the letter and are subject to subsequent revision by the
Fund’s auditors. Past performance may not be indicative of future results and no representation is made
that an investor will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. All investments involve risk
including the loss of principal.
Net Return reflects the experience of an investor who came into the Fund on inception and did not add to
or withdraw from the Fund through the end of the most recently reported period. The reported net return
figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.

Inflation is rising quickly - likely connected to a combination of the Fed’s extended zero interest rate policy, massive fiscal stimulus during Covid, and supply chain issues mainly due to Covid. As measured by the S&P 500, the market has only had one negative year since 2008. 12 out of 13 positive years, with the one down year being only 4.6% is quite a run. Cedar Creek held during the first quarter and managed to end the quarter up by 0.5%, net of fees and expenses. Of the major indices we compare against, the Dow Jones Industrial Average performed the best, declining by 4.1% in the quarter. The Russell 2000 was the laggard, declining by 7.5%. While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on micro cap stocks, and over-the-counter stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify our existence. Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen year history is 14.3%, net of fees and expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 776%, net of fees and expenses. Q1 ‘22 2021 Inception Ave. Annual Cedar Creek 0.5% 38.9% 776.3% 14.3% NASDAQ -9.1% 21.4% 513.7% 11.8% S&P 500 (SPY) -4.6% 28.6% 382.6% 10.2% DJIA (DIA) -4.1% 20.8% 360.6% 9.9% Russell 2000 -7.5% 14.8% 263.1% 8.3% Russell Micro Cap -7.6% 19.3% 202.8% 7.1% * fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell. $100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $876,307 as of March 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes we compare against would have only grown to between $302,762 in the Russell Micro Cap and $613,736 in the NASDAQ. Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices On the whole, as of the end of March 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at less than 10 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and just 6.5 times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses. Weighted price to book was 1.4. Dividend yield was 0.3%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was 14.7%. Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning We started the quarter with cash levels at just under 18% and ended the quarter at 5%. We closed out a few minor positions such as Hennessy Advisors (HNNA) and Colicity (COLIU). On the buy side we added a number of smaller positions. Many of these are shown in our “basket of deplorables” described later in the letter. We also funded a non-public investment. Tix Corporation, a company we previously owned shares in, fell upon hard times during COVID and filed for bankruptcy. Tix, which sells show tickets in Las Vegas, re-opened last fall with three locations on the strip. We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a private investor to bid on the company and won the auction. Or maybe we should say we were high bidder. We won’t know if we truly won for a while. The investment was less than ten percent of the fund’s assets. The business, excluding legal costs related to the transaction, has operated profitably since our purchase at the end of February. Rents along the strip are extremely high which results in significant operating leverage. Once fixed costs are covered incremental margins are very attractive. It is too early to know if the business will get back to pre-covid levels or how much competition we will face. A new competitor entered the market in the last few weeks. Shows are still in the process of re-opening so we are cautiously optimistic about the future. Expert Market Exposure We mentioned last quarter that we had increased cash levels hoping to take advantage of the effects of Rule 15c2-11 on some illiquid names. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not subject to the buying restriction. We continue to make smaller purchases of “expert market” stocks and are on the prowl for more. We hope to build a basket of smaller positions. We are not going to mention names at this point. w us to continue to take advantage of what is in our view an idiotic rule. Our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 19% of the fund’s assets. Four positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX) which is 4% of the fund, CCUR (CCUR) which is about 3%, and Mortgage Oil Company (MGAG) which is just under 3% of the fund. We are building a position in a fourth, that is currently just over 3%, and look forward to describing it in more detail. We discussed PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2 2021 letter (link). Our “Basket of Deplorables” Not to get political, but we find the name humorous. We are using it in a mixed way – many of the stocks have management, or capital allocation, that is deplorable. Yet in our opinion, the price more than reflects that reality, such that the stocks are not actually deplorable. (We know if you have to explain the “joke,” it is not really humorous…). Anyways, below are holdings in the fund that are unloved by the market. They share many similarities. As the majority owner column shows they tend to have a controlling owner. They nearly all are trading at a discount to book value and have significant cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Nearly all are illiquid. We use the term basket since none are individually a large component of the fund aside from PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX). net P/E Major Company Symbol trading price BVPS cash/sec EPS P/B P/E net of $ Owner 180 Degree Capital TURN nasdaq $ 6 .50 $ 10.66 $ 10.66 from inv 61% No Addmaster ADDC expert $ 19.25 $ 31.01 $ 20.47 $ 1.10 62% 17.5 ( 1.1) Yes Alimco Financial ALMC expert $ 7 .00 $ 9 .87 $ 9 .78 ? 71% Yes ALJ Regional ALJJ nasdaq $ 2 .42 $ 4 .22 $ 3 .23 loss 57% Yes Altair ATCD expert $ 2,471 $ 4,700 $ 4,450 $ 267.00 53% 9.3 ( 7.4) Yes CCUR CCUR expert $ 6,625 $ 23,376 $ 10,141 ? 28% Yes Dyna Group DGIX expert $ 0 .44 $ 1 .24 $ 0 .37 $ 0.16 35% 2.8 0.4 Yes Symbolic Logic EVOL nasdaq $ 1 .00 $ 3 .06 $ 3 .20 shell 33% close Harbor Diversified HRBR otc $ 2 .48 $ 3 .19 $ 2 .27 $ 0.50 78% 5.0 0.4 Yes Initio INTO otc $ 0 .33 $ 1 .05 $ 1 .05 from inv 31% Yes PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals PDRX expert $ 3 .00 $ 4.95 $ 1.69 $ 0.47 61% 6.4 2.8 No ?

Our projections. * Steven Kiel/Arquitos owns 28.5%. Proposed merger will make David Sherman the majority owner Our preference is for securities that are growing yet are priced like they are not. They are rare. Most high growth stocks are priced for perfection, and due to a high valuation are not attractive to us. That tends to leave us sifting through lower growth stocks that are for various reasons unloved, and no-growth stocks that are selling for less than what we think the business or assets are worth. The above basket is primarily no-growth stocks and most are valued based on their high quality assets (cash and securities). We have to be patient when buying and selling the no growth asset stocks, and avoid becoming too greedy. In other words, in order to make money we try to buy when we think they are ridiculously cheap and try to sell at a more modest discount to a fair price. A few do not have operating businesses and any growth will only reflect portfolio performance, such as Initio (INTO) or Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Co. (PAWH), or an eventual acquisition, such as Rubicon Technology (RBCN)). A few have nice little businesses such as Spindletop (SPND), Reserve Petroleum (RSRV), and Western Capital Resources (WCRS) where we get decent exposure to the business while retaining substantial downside protection due to their balance sheets. Others have decent businesses but are hiding in the dark, like Dyna Group (DGIX). The company does not want to report publicly and due to the presence of a controlling owner there is little we can do about it. Every now and then we can buy shares at less than cash and believe that over time we will earn a decent return. Queen City Investments – Royally Bad Capital Allocation One of the names on the list is Queen City Investments (QUCT). It was spun off from Farmers & Merchants Bank of Long Beach (FMBL) in 1973. FMBL itself was founded in 1907 by C.J. Walker and as far as we know, has been controlled by the Walker family ever since. It is a conservatively run bank. Total assets are nearly $11.7 billion. The bank has always had a very conservative balance sheet. Historically it has kept nearly half of the assets on its balance sheet in government securities. Equity to assets was in the 20% range for decades, which is more than twice what the typical bank kept. Despite the drag of lower earning securities, and excess equity, the bank still managed to earn just under double digit returns on equity. Its earnings are due to a low cost deposit base. In other words, Queen City has a very conservative parent, and it shows. Queen City has 47,739 shares outstanding with a last trade of $1,300 per share. It is described as an investment company. It initially held securities in FMBL and a 27,000 acre cattle ranch in Arroyo Grande, California (Central coast, inland from Pismo Beach, near San Luis Obispo). We are not sure when it occurred, but it no longer owns shares in FMBL. Today, it really is a trust company. As of the end of 2021 it managed $6.17 billion in assets for 1,391 trust accounts, a solid increase from the $4.34 billion in assets for 1,304 accounts at the end of 2020. In addition to the ranch, it owns some real estate, including one of FMBL’s branches. Queen City also owns a large pile of treasury bills. Roughly $29 million, or over $600 per share of QUCT. That is the problem. The trust business is fabulous, with a return on equity of approximately 90%. What QUCT’s management has done is paired this fabulous, capital light, high ROE business with a portfolio of t-bills – an asset that is the opposite – poor performing, capital intensive, miniscule ROE “business.” The end result is that all the earnings of the fabulous business are being reinvested at 1.5%, a rate that not only historically very low, but is now well below inflation. To put it another way, every dollar they retain is worth less a year later. (See the next page for our segment analysis). There is absolutely no reason that we can think of for QUCT to do this. It does not relate the trust business. The annual report notes that the pledged assets to ensure faithful performance of fiduciary duties is less than $1 million. We should also point out, the same poor capital allocation applies to it owning a 27,000 cattle ranch that appears marginally profitable, yet could likely be sold for more than $20 million. Management even borrowed $4 million for a real estate investment at prime (3.25%), which is a great rate, but really makes no sense while perpetually sitting on nearly $30 million of lower yielding treasury bills. Some may ask, why own it then? Fair question. Last summer, after nearly fifteen years of a stagnant share price, and twenty five years with no dividend increase, we believed that shares at just over $1,000 were an attractive low-risk opportunity. We knew cash and securities were roughly $700 per share and that the business was earning in excess of $80 per share. In other words, we were paying less than four times earnings net of cash, which was attributing nothing to the 27,000 acre ranch. With 47,739 shares, each share “owns” 0.57 acres. If the ranch at the time of our purchase was only worth $14 million, or $300 per share, we were getting the trust business for “free” ($700 per share of t-bills and $300+ per share for the ranch). We haven’t even delved into the rental properties. Our segment analysis shows the rental properties as earning $900,000 and that is after accounting for $754,000 of depreciation. Rental properties are typically valued on FFO (funds from operations) which is basically cash flow or net income plus depreciation. Assuming a 15x multiple, the $1.65 million in cash flows would be worth around $25 million, or nearly $520 per share. Note 5 of the annual report notes a basis of $25.5 million, so we think we are being conservative. Based on a sum of the parts analysis, which admittedly can be dangerous, the non trust company segments are conservatively worth $1,400 per share. We are up 25-30% since we purchased last year and know if QUCT management ever got serious about creating shareholder value we could do significantly better. Even if it doesn’t happen soon, we think eventually family members, who are shareholders, will catch on over time, and push for change. It seems doubtful the trust business would ever be sold due to its connections to the bank, but the other three segments are not essential. One last point on the trust business that got our attention was that revenue rose $1.1 million in 2021 versus 2020 while personnel compensation declined by $10,000. The prior year, revenue had risen by nearly $700,000 and personnel costs had only risen by $40,000. That is excellent operating leverage, and important since sometimes the profits from these kinds of securities are siphoned off via salaries. We would propose that Queen City liquidate most of the treasury bills and either pay a $500 per share special dividend or allocate the $500 per share to a tender offer, which would allow them to reduce shares by up to one-third. Either would show that management is serious about capital allocation and would improve shareholders view of the company. After that they could look at either selling the ranch or spinning it off, possibly with the real estate.

Subject: Cedar Creek Partners 2022 First Quarter Results
Dear Partners and Friends:
In hindsight it is not surprising that the markets are down this year. Inflation is rising
quickly - likely connected to a combination of the Fed’s extended zero interest rate policy,
massive fiscal stimulus during Covid, and supply chain issues mainly due to Covid. As
measured by the S&P 500, the market has only had one negative year since 2008. 12 out
of 13 positive years, with the one down year being only 4.6% is quite a run. Cedar Creek
held during the first quarter and managed to end the quarter up by 0.5%, net of fees and
expenses.1 Of the major indices we compare against, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
performed the best, declining by 4.1% in the quarter. The Russell 2000 was the laggard,
declining by 7.5%.
While Cedar Creek Partners focuses primarily on micro cap stocks, and over-the-counter
stocks in particular, we compare our returns against larger indices as well since we believe
we need to outperform the most prominent passive benchmarks over time in order to justify
our existence.
Cedar Creek’s average annual return over our sixteen year history is 14.3%, net of fees and
expenses, which compares favorably to all the indices we compare against. Cumulative
returns since inception for Cedar Creek were 776%, net of fees and expenses.

* fund inception January 15, 2006. Index Returns as reported on Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar, Dow Jones and Russell.
$100,000 invested in the fund at inception in January 2006 would have grown to $876,307
as of March 31, 2022, net of fees and expenses, whereas $100,000 invested in the indexes
we compare against would have only grown to between $302,762 in the Russell Micro Cap
and $613,736 in the NASDAQ.
1 While, no single index is directly comparable to Cedar Creek Partners, we believe that it is important to compare
our performance to a passively managed approach. At the core of our investment philosophy is the belief that we
can generate superior risk-adjusted returns by holding a more concentrated portfolio of under-valued securities, than
an index holding a far greater number of securities. Index returns are calculated from information reported on
Yahoo! Finance, Dow Jones, and Russell (see DISCLAIMER for more information).

Fund Holdings are at Incredibly Attractive Prices
On the whole, as of the end of March 2022, the fund’s holdings were trading at
less than 10 times our estimate of earnings for the coming year, and just 6.5
times earnings net of cash at the respective businesses.2 Weighted price to book
was 1.4. Dividend yield was 0.3%. Weighted return on equity as of March 31, 2022 was
14.7%.
Cash Levels and Fund Repositioning
We started the quarter with cash levels at just under 18% and ended the quarter at 5%.
We closed out a few minor positions such as Hennessy Advisors (HNNA) and Colicity
(COLIU).
On the buy side we added a number of smaller positions. Many of these are shown in our
“basket of deplorables” described later in the letter. We also funded a non-public
investment. Tix Corporation, a company we previously owned shares in, fell upon hard
times during COVID and filed for bankruptcy. Tix, which sells show tickets in Las Vegas, re-
opened last fall with three locations on the strip. We partnered with Jeff Gramm at Bandera
Partners, Haren Bhakta at HSB Capital and a private investor to bid on the company and
won the auction. Or maybe we should say we were high bidder. We won’t know if we truly
won for a while. The investment was less than ten percent of the fund’s assets.
The business, excluding legal costs related to the transaction, has operated profitably since
our purchase at the end of February. Rents along the strip are extremely high which
results in significant operating leverage. Once fixed costs are covered incremental margins
are very attractive. It is too early to know if the business will get back to pre-covid levels
or how much competition we will face. A new competitor entered the market in the last few
weeks. Shows are still in the process of re-opening so we are cautiously optimistic about
the future.
Expert Market Exposure
We mentioned last quarter that we had increased cash levels hoping to take advantage of
the effects of Rule 15c2-11 on some illiquid names. For those unfamiliar, the rule prevents
brokers from not only displaying quotes for non-reporting companies but also restricts
transactions to selling only. Institutional accounts, depending on the broker, are not
subject to the buying restriction.
We continue to make smaller purchases of “expert market” stocks and are on the prowl for
more. We hope to build a basket of smaller positions. We are not going to mention names
at this point. w us to continue to take advantage of what is in our view an idiotic rule.
Our current exposure to expert market stocks is approximately 19% of the fund’s assets.
Four positions make up about 65% of the amount – PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals (PDRX)
which is 4% of the fund, CCUR (CCUR) which is about 3%, and Mortgage Oil Company
(MGAG) which is just under 3% of the fund. We are building a position in a fourth, that is
currently just over 3%, and look forward to describing it in more detail. We discussed PD-
Rx Pharmaceuticals briefly in our Q1 2021 letter, and Mortgage Oil in more depth in Q2
2021 letter (link).
2 Ratio excludes cash held by the fund. We add back non-economic amortization in our earnings estimate.

Our “Basket of Deplorables”
Not to get political, but we find the name humorous. We are using it in a mixed way –
many of the stocks have management, or capital allocation, that is deplorable. Yet in our
opinion, the price more than reflects that reality, such that the stocks are not actually
deplorable. (We know if you have to explain the “joke,” it is not really humorous…).
Anyways, below are holdings in the fund that are unloved by the market. They share many
similarities. As the majority owner column shows they tend to have a controlling owner.
They nearly all are trading at a discount to book value and have significant cash and
marketable securities on the balance sheet. Nearly all are illiquid. We use the term basket
since none are individually a large component of the fund aside from PD-Rx
Pharmaceuticals (PDRX).

Our preference is for securities that are growing yet are priced like they are not. They are
rare. Most high growth stocks are priced for perfection, and due to a high valuation are not
attractive to us. That tends to leave us sifting through lower growth stocks that are for
various reasons unloved, and no-growth stocks that are selling for less than what we think
the business or assets are worth. The above basket is primarily no-growth stocks and most
are valued based on their high quality assets (cash and securities). We have to be patient
when buying and selling the no growth asset stocks, and avoid becoming too greedy. In
other words, in order to make money we try to buy when we think they are ridiculously
cheap and try to sell at a more modest discount to a fair price.
A few do not have operating businesses and any growth will only reflect portfolio
performance, such as Initio (INTO) or Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit
Co. (PAWH), or an eventual acquisition, such as Rubicon Technology (RBCN)). A few
have nice little businesses such as Spindletop (SPND), Reserve Petroleum (RSRV), and
Western Capital Resources (WCRS) where we get decent exposure to the business while
retaining substantial downside protection due to their balance sheets. Others have decent
businesses but are hiding in the dark, like Dyna Group (DGIX). The company does not
want to report publicly and due to the presence of a controlling owner there is little we can
do about it. Every now and then we can buy shares at less than cash and believe that over
time we will earn a decent return.

Queen City Investments – Royally Bad Capital Allocation
One of the names on the list is Queen City Investments (QUCT). It was spun off from
Farmers & Merchants Bank of Long Beach (FMBL) in 1973. FMBL itself was founded in
1907 by C.J. Walker and as far as we know, has been controlled by the Walker family ever
since. It is a conservatively run bank. Total assets are nearly $11.7 billion. The bank has
always had a very conservative balance sheet. Historically it has kept nearly half of the
assets on its balance sheet in government securities. Equity to assets was in the 20%
range for decades, which is more than twice what the typical bank kept. Despite the drag
of lower earning securities, and excess equity, the bank still managed to earn just under
double digit returns on equity. Its earnings are due to a low cost deposit base. In other
words, Queen City has a very conservative parent, and it shows.
Queen City has 47,739 shares outstanding with a last trade of $1,300 per share. It is
described as an investment company. It initially held securities in FMBL and a 27,000 acre
cattle ranch in Arroyo Grande, California (Central coast, inland from Pismo Beach, near San
Luis Obispo). We are not sure when it occurred, but it no longer owns shares in FMBL.
Today, it really is a trust company. As of the end of 2021 it managed $6.17 billion in assets
for 1,391 trust accounts, a solid increase from the $4.34 billion in assets for 1,304 accounts
at the end of 2020. In addition to the ranch, it owns some real estate, including one of
FMBL’s branches.
Queen City also owns a large pile of treasury bills. Roughly $29 million, or over $600 per
share of QUCT. That is the problem. The trust business is fabulous, with a return on equity
of approximately 90%. What QUCT’s management has done is paired this fabulous, capital
light, high ROE business with a portfolio of t-bills – an asset that is the opposite – poor
performing, capital intensive, miniscule ROE “business.” The end result is that all the
earnings of the fabulous business are being reinvested at 1.5%, a rate that not only
historically very low, but is now well below inflation. To put it another way, every dollar
they retain is worth less a year later. (See the next page for our segment analysis).
There is absolutely no reason that we can think of for QUCT to do this. It does not relate
the trust business. The annual report notes that the pledged assets to ensure faithful
performance of fiduciary duties is less than $1 million. We should also point out, the same
poor capital allocation applies to it owning a 27,000 cattle ranch that appears marginally
profitable, yet could likely be sold for more than $20 million. Management even borrowed
$4 million for a real estate investment at prime (3.25%), which is a great rate, but really
makes no sense while perpetually sitting on nearly $30 million of lower yielding treasury
bills.
Some may ask, why own it then? Fair question. Last summer, after nearly fifteen years of
a stagnant share price, and twenty five years with no dividend increase, we believed that
shares at just over $1,000 were an attractive low-risk opportunity. We knew cash and
securities were roughly $700 per share and that the business was earning in excess of $80
per share. In other words, we were paying less than four times earnings net of cash, which
was attributing nothing to the 27,000 acre ranch. With 47,739 shares, each share “owns”
0.57 acres. If the ranch at the time of our purchase was only worth $14 million, or $300
per share, we were getting the trust business for “free” ($700 per share of t-bills and
$300+ per share for the ranch).
We haven’t even delved into the rental properties. Our segment analysis shows the rental
properties as earning $900,000 and that is after accounting for $754,000 of depreciation.
Rental properties are typically valued on FFO (funds from operations) which is basically
cash flow or net income plus depreciation. Assuming a 15x multiple, the $1.65 million in

Source: Google Finance
cash flows would be worth around $25 million, or nearly $520 per share. Note 5 of the
annual report notes a basis of $25.5 million, so we think we are being conservative. Based
on a sum of the parts analysis, which admittedly can be dangerous, the non trust company
segments are conservatively worth $1,400 per share. We are up 25-30% since we
purchased last year and know if QUCT management ever got serious about creating
shareholder value we could do significantly better.
Even if it doesn’t happen soon, we think eventually family members, who are shareholders,
will catch on over time, and push for change. It seems doubtful the trust business would
ever be sold due to its connections to the bank, but the other three segments are not
essential. One last point on the trust business that got our attention was that revenue rose
$1.1 million in 2021 versus 2020 while personnel compensation declined by $10,000. The
prior year, revenue had risen by nearly $700,000 and personnel costs had only risen by
$40,000. That is excellent operating leverage, and important since sometimes the profits
from these kinds of securities are siphoned off via salaries.
We would propose that Queen City liquidate most of the treasury bills and either pay a
$500 per share special dividend or allocate the $500 per share to a tender offer, which
would allow them to reduce shares by up to one-third. Either would show that
management is serious about capital allocation and would improve shareholders view of the
company. After that they could look at either selling the ranch or spinning it off, possibly
with the real estate. Lastly, with the trust business not needing additional capital, Queen
City could increase the dividend to a more meaningful percentage of net income.

figures will therefore include the impact of high water marks in the cumulative return. Individual investor
returns will vary depending upon the timing of their investment, the effects of additions and withdrawals
from their capital account, and each individual’s high water mark figure, if any.
Index Returns
The S&P500 Index returns are reported using the S&P500 Depository Receipt Trust (SPDR) which
trades under the ticker symbol SPY. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet
showing the SPY performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
Nasdaq performance excludes dividends, which historically have been immaterial to the total return of
that index. In recent years more technology stocks have begun paying dividends thus the inclusion of
dividends would increase the reported figures.
Russell 2000 performance is from data reported on Russell’s website, and includes reinvested dividends.
DJIA returns are reported using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average which trades under the ticker
symbol DIA. Reinvested dividends are included in these figures. A spreadsheet showing the DIA
performance versus the fund since inception is available upon request.
While reported returns for SPY and DIA will likely be a few tenths of a percentage lower than the
representative index annually, we believe they are a better reflection of what a non-institutional investor
would earn following a passive investment approach.
Index returns are provided as a convenience to the reader only. The Fund’s returns are likely to differ
substantially from that of any index, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
that are superior to such indices.
Share Prices
Share price figures for listed stocks are from Yahoo! Finance and unless specified otherwise are the
closing price as of the previous month end. Share price figures for unlisted stocks are closing bid prices
as reported on otcmarkets.com, except for unlisted stocks classified as expert market, which do not have
public availability of quotes, and are marked to last sale.

Letter to Limited Partners Fourth Quarter 2022

The views from atop Mt. Washington and Troy Hill today offer sweeping
vistas of the wide valley containing the city of Pittsburgh. However, they also
offer a glimpse at the handiwork of nearly a million years worth of geologic
development.
As shown on the cover image, the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers have,
over millennia, carved into the landscape and distributed an assortment of
sand, gravel, and other sediments. Though these rivers, their flows no longer
impacted by glaciers advancing into the region, meander along fewer paths
than they once did, their work has been done. At the confluence of the
Allegheny and the Monongahela, and upon the alluvial deposits they once
carried, sits the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund returned 4.2% in the fourth quarter, slightly behind benchmarks. For the full year,
Alluvial Fund declined by 14.9% while small-cap and micro-cap indexes lost 19-22%. After six
full years of operations, Alluvial Fund has returned 12.2% annually net of all fees and expenses
compared to 5-6% annually for comparable small-cap and micro-cap benchmarks.
Investing can be likened to feeding dollars into a mysterious machine. Most of the time, the
machine rattles and smokes and then spits out a dollar, plus a few cents. Usually 5 cents or 15, now
and then more. What a miraculous device! But sometimes, something goes awry and the machine
returns only 80 or 90 cents. Or once in a great while, just 50 or 60! Despite these malfunctions, it’s
easy to understand why this metaphorical machine is so popular. Those who are willing to shoulder
the occasional losses are highly likely to walk away much richer given enough repetitions. This
machine, like the stock market, is an amazing wealth creator.

The purpose of Alluvial Fund is to be a better machine that creates wealth faster. (Otherwise, why
pay me a dime?) Thus far, it has been. A big part of our outperformance is owed to our ability to
avoid the worst of the market’s losses during downturns, a pattern that repeated this year. Since
inception, we have always had a strong preference for boring companies with strong balance
sheets and predictable cash flows. Businesses like these can be frustrating to own when the market
is soaring, but they prove their worth when the bubble bursts.
2023 is off to a reasonably good start. I don’t know if this trend will continue or if it will be another
frustrating year. I do know that at current prices, our holdings offer excellent value. I continue to
seek out additional opportunities, a few of which are featured for the first time in this letter.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

Portfolio Updates
Last time I wrote, I introduced a new investing theme: ECIP banks. These banks were the lucky
recipients of huge slugs of nearly zero-cost equity capital courtesy of the US Treasury. Our basket
of ECIP banks has performed well, each up at least 20% from our average purchase price. As
I write this letter, these banks collectively represent Alluvial Fund’s largest position. Each bank
remains distinctly undervalued, a situation that will continue to resolve as awareness of their new
economics grows. Many of the banks that received ECIP funding have mediocre credit quality
and a spotty earnings history; not ours. In my view, investing in banks that were delivering for
shareholders before being supercharged by ECIP funds is the lowest-risk approach to participating
in this theme.
On the topic of superchargers, our investment in Garrett Motion preferred shares is performing
well. Garrett Motion shares have been rising as the semiconductor supply chain normalizes,
unsnarling automotive production. Additionally, rumors of a possible sale began swirling in
November. The company has not commented on the rumors, but an eventual sale has always been
the most likely outcome for Garrett Motion. Should a sale come to pass, I think holders of Garrett’s
convertible preferreds can expect at least $12.
It has been a quiet stretch for P10 Inc., our second-largest holding as of the date of this letter.
Third quarter earnings were healthy. The fundraising environment for alternative investments is
tougher now than it was a year ago, but P10 continues to add assets under management and
has maintained its 2023 targets. Fortunately for P10, it does not have significant exposure to the
most challenged of asset classes, real estate. On the third quarter earnings conference call, Co-
CEO Clark Webb remarked “….I will tell you, it’s much harder today to allocate capital externally
when our stock trades where it does. So you can see that we have instituted a buyback and have
begun buying back shares. But we are certainly hard-pressed to find businesses like ours trading
at valuations like us. And so we do have a new competitor in the room, if you will, which is our
own stock.” No argument from me! At higher valuations, I would rather see P10 use its resources
to acquire new alternative assets managers than repurchase shares. But at these prices, the case
for repurchasing shares is compelling. The company took advantage of the dip below $10 to
repurchase quite a few shares and announced a $20 million increase to the buyback authorization
at year-end. Shares have rebounded from the lows but remain extremely cheap.
Unidata SpA announced yet another ambitious development: the acquisition of TWT Group.
Acquiring TWT will nearly double Unidata’s revenues and will add an asset-light services business
with a national presence to complement Unidata’s existing Rome-centered infrastructure-heavy
business. Unidata will fund the purchase with a combination of cash and debt, plus TWT’s largest
shareholder will roll a portion of the purchase price into Unidata shares. Unidata also announced its
financial partner for the Tyrrhenian Sea undersea cable, an Italian infrastructure fund. Two or three
years out, we are looking at a much larger and more profitable Unidata. I expect the market to
reward Unidata’s increased scale and more liquid shares with an appropriately higher multiple and
share price.
Our Polish holdings had a tough year. Despite declining share prices, the underlying economic
performance of these businesses, Auto Partner SA in particular, has been excellent. The macro
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

environment in Poland has been seriously challenging, leading many Polish investors to abandon
local equities for the safety of government debt or foreign stocks. However, there are signs that
inflation is easing and that investor trepidation is on the wane. Bottom line: our Polish holdings are
high quality, growing businesses trading at mid-single digit multiples of earnings. Businesses like
these do not remain cheap forever.
I wish I could say that all our holdings graced us with excellent earnings reports this quarter.
Unfortunately, there was one significant disappointment in GEE Group, our employment agency
turnaround in progress. Shares ran up to start the fourth quarter as investors grew excited about
the company’s recent successes and dirt-cheap valuation. But hopes were dashed as the company
reported essentially zero profit in the fourth quarter after several consecutive quarters of healthy
earnings. Revenue and gross profits were both fine, still riding high as the tight labor market rolls
on. But operating costs ballooned, mostly the result of the company accruing large bonuses and
incentive payments at the end of the fiscal year. I don’t have a problem with the bonuses. In a
year of record revenue and profits, the staff
deserve their reward. I do have an issue with
the company dealing shareholders a nasty TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 12/31/22 (%)
shock by cramming these bonuses into a P10 Inc. 10.6

throughout the year. The news wasn’t all bad.
The company still produced $1 million in Unidata S.p.A. 8.2

Butler National Corp. 3.6
concerns me much more is GEE Group’s
failure to commit publicly to a capital Total, Top Ten 59.6%
allocation framework. The company has
been accumulating cash far in excess of its operating needs for several quarters now, yet it has
not chosen to reward shareholders with a return of capital or increase its earnings power with
acquisitions or internal initiatives. Back in December, the CEO promised the board would meet to
consider implementing a share buyback once earnings were “digested” by the market. He also
promised “good things” ahead. We’re still waiting. GEE Group will report to shareholders again
in just a few weeks. I expect a much-improved report and some answers on the capital allocation
question. These answers will determine whether GEE Group maintains its place in our portfolio.
With so many other great opportunities out there, there’s no room for a company that repeatedly
fails to deliver on its promises, no matter how optically cheap its shares may be.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

Special Situations
Alluvial Fund’s special situations holdings contributed well to close out the year. Pegroco Invest
AB inches closer and closer to repaying the accrued dividends on its preferred shares. The firm
announced it would merge with another investment company with an eye toward an exchange
listing for its common shares in 2023. To pull this off, Pegroco will need to take the final step
toward cleaning up its capital structure by going fully current on its dividends.
We identified an attractive liquidation scenario in the fourth quarter: Retail Value Inc. “RVI” was
once the owner of numerous shopping centers across the USA. Now all these properties are sold
and RVI is just a cash shell that will pay off all remaining liabilities and distribute the remaining
proceeds over the next few years. I expect the distributions to be heavily weighted toward 2023
and 2024. As far as liquidations go, Retail Value is an especially clean situation. There are no
“squishy” assets of uncertain value. The company’s liabilities are well-defined and highly unlikely to
be re-estimated upwards. In fact, I believe the company is being quite conservative in its estimate
of the remaining liquidation expenses. When all is said and done, I expect to receive around 31
cents per share in liquidation proceeds, well
above our average cost of around 20 cents
TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/22 (%)
per share. Alluvial Fund is the owner of nearly
United States 74.9
1.7 million RVIC shares, equal to 7.9% of
the total outstanding. Our 13G filing (the Eurozone 13.2
fund’s first!) can be viewed here. A special

Total 100%
Currently, I am looking at another Swedish
preferred stock that I believe will resume
paying dividends in 2023. And in a few months, we will receive the final payment on a bankruptcy-
related royalty security I haven’t mentioned before due to my continued efforts to acquire more of
the exceptionally illiquid units. I continue to expect special situations investments to play a greater
role in the Alluvial Fund portfolio in the coming years.
New Holdings: Introducing Fitlife and Supremex
Alluvial Fund has a meaningful new holding in Fitlife Brands, a retailer of health and fitness
supplements. While the economics are good and the value is compelling, our investment is also
a “jockey” bet on Fitlife’s CEO and controlling shareholder, Dayton Judd. In past letters, I have
mentioned that within the ecosystem of micro-cap companies, there are a few individuals whose
every move is worthy of attention. Mr. Judd is one of those people. I first crossed paths with Mr.
Judd years ago when we were both invested in Otelco, an underperforming telecom provider.
We discussed various ways of achieving better outcomes for shareholders. Ultimately, I choose to
move on. Mr. Judd got himself appointed to the Otelco board of directors and, eventually, won
a reasonable outcome for shareholders despite Otelco being, in retrospect, a weakly-positioned
and capital-starved company. Following that, Mr. Judd moved on to new projects including Fitlife.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

Over time, Mr. Judd has built Fitlife by adding new brands and building new distribution channels,
including a healthy e-commerce presence. The returns have been phenomenal. So good, I kick
myself for not casting our lot in with Fitlife earlier.
Presently, Fitlife operates through 9 different brands. The various products are meant to aid
bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts in building muscle and burning fat—think whey protein,
creatine, amino acids, pre and post workout shakes, etc. Not my thing, but people swear by
this stuff and Fitlife’s customers give it rave reviews. The biggest distribution channel for Fitlife’s
products is GNC stores, but the company has been working hard to increase sales through Amazon
and direct through its website.
For the 12 trailing months, Fitlife recorded revenue of $31.2 million, operating income of $6.5
million, and net income of $5.2 million. The company has $14.9 million in cash and no debt. At the
current share price, this works out to 14.3x earnings, or 11.2x earnings backing out the company’s
cash. This is a reasonable valuation for a fast-growing, highly profitable, well-managed firm, but
the story is about to get a lot more compelling. Fitlife has agreed to buy Mimi’s Rock, a Canadian
health foods retailer. While Mimi’s Rock managed to build multiple successful brands, it has long
been burdened with excessive overhead and an over-leveraged balance sheet–both problems that
Mr. Judd can address. The acquisition will double Fitlife’s annual revenue and increase its operating
income by at least 50%. Fitlife will fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and
a moderate amount of low-cost debt, which it expects to pay down completely within a year.
Once the acquisition has been completed and the new brands integrated with Fitlife’s platform, I
expect the transaction to increase Fitlife’s earnings by more than 50%. Beyond the purely financial,
this acquisition will also reduce Fitlife’s dependence on GNC, cutting GNC sales from two-thirds
of revenue to one-third. E-commerce will become a much more substantial portion of Fitlife’s
distribution.
The Mimi’s Rock acquisition is a big step, but I know Mr. Judd has plenty more building to do. I am
excited to be along for the ride.
Like Fitlife Brands, we have also been looking northward for opportunities. A second new holding
I’d like to mention is Supremex Inc., a manufacturer of envelopes and packaging materials with
operations in Canada and the US. Over time, Supremex has built its envelope business, both
organically and through acquisitions, to the point where it now occupies a dominant position
in the Canadian market. Envelopes are certainly not a growth market—I may have finally found
something less exciting than rural telecoms!—but the expected perpetual decline here all but
guarantees that nobody will attempt to build a new envelope manufacturing facility. Supremex
is essentially the “last man standing” in a declining industry, the result of which is pricing power.
Indeed, the selling price of Supremex’s envelopes was up 30% year-over-year in the third quarter
without any noticeable effect on the volume of sales. Some of the price increase was due to
inflationary pressures, but the increase more than compensated for increased raw materials costs,
allowing Supremex to earn record margins.
Supremex is aware that the envelope market is in decline and is dedicating its cash flow and
acquisition efforts toward the growing packaging market. Packaging has been a hot area
due to the steady growth of online retail and the movement away from plastic toward more
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

environmentally friendly, recyclable paper and cardboard packaging. Just days ago, Supremex
announced the acquisition of Paragraph, a Quebec packaging producer. But Supremex isn’t just an
acquirer. Management also likes to reward shareholders with significant share buybacks and regular
dividends.
Despite its recent successes, the market still views Supremex as a dinosaur. Shares change hands at
just 6.5x trailing earnings, a ratio that is sure to fall once fourth quarter 2022 results are reported.
Looking ahead, the recent acquisitions of Paragraph and a small US envelope producer, Royal
Envelope, will further bolster results. Harvesting cash flows from a declining business to reinvest in
a more promising segment is not the easiest tightrope to walk, but so far, Supremex is managing
the transition with excellence.
I continue to enjoy searching for opportunities in the expert market. Any market where many can
sell but few can buy will regularly serve up chances to buy securities on incredibly attractive terms.
Near year-end, I was able to acquire shares of a deregistered structured product that holds long-
term debt issued by a giant investment-grade S&P 500 company. The underlying bonds trade at a
small premium to par, but the structured product, solely due to falling to the expert market, trades
at a 35% discount and yields >10%. Simply too good to pass up. A 10% rate of return is below our
usual return targets, but not when it can be achieved with little risk. There is a chance our ultimate
realized return could be higher if the security becomes exchange-traded again or if the issuer
tenders for the underlying debt or structured product units.
Concluding Thoughts
I am pleased with Alluvial Fund’s track record. Still, my responsibility as investment manager is to
improve, improve, improve. I have spent a lot of time this winter thinking about what has and has
not worked over our six-year history. More of the former, less of the latter. The next six years will be
better because I will be better.
I am thankful for the numerous partners who committed additional capital to the fund last year,
and to the many new partners who joined. I am also grateful for my associate, Tom Kapfer, who
contributed immensely to Alluvial’s research processes. Quarter after quarter, Tom edits these
missives into something almost readable.
We will soon begin the annual audit and tax reporting processes. Once again, we will work to
finalize each as quickly as possible to avoid causing undue delays in your tax preparation.
In the coming weeks, we will host a webinar to update partners on Alluvial Fund developments
and allow for questions and comments. Information will follow. In the meantime and as always, feel
free to contact me at any time. I thank you, as always, for the opportunity to manage your hard-
earned dollars. I will do all I can to grow your capital alongside mine in 2023.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund returned 4.2% in the fourth quarter, slightly behind benchmarks. For the full year,
Alluvial Fund declined by 14.9% while small-cap and micro-cap indexes lost 19-22%. After six
full years of operations, Alluvial Fund has returned 12.2% annually net of all fees and expenses
compared to 5-6% annually for comparable small-cap and micro-cap benchmarks.

Portfolio Updates
Last time I wrote, I introduced a new investing theme: ECIP banks. These banks were the lucky
recipients of huge slugs of nearly zero-cost equity capital courtesy of the US Treasury. Our basket
of ECIP banks has performed well, each up at least 20% from our average purchase price. As

On the topic of superchargers, our investment in Garrett Motion preferred shares is performing
well. Garrett Motion shares have been rising as the semiconductor supply chain normalizes,
unsnarling automotive production. Additionally, rumors of a possible sale began swirling in

the most likely outcome for Garrett Motion. Should a sale come to pass, I think holders of Garrett’s

It has been a quiet stretch for P10 Inc., our second-largest holding as of the date of this letter.
Third quarter earnings were healthy. The fundraising environment for alternative investments is
tougher now than it was a year ago, but P10 continues to add assets under management and

reward Unidata’s increased scale and more liquid shares with an appropriately higher multiple and
share price.
Our Polish holdings had a tough year. Despite declining share prices, the underlying economic
performance of these businesses, Auto Partner SA in particular, has been excellent. The macro

environment in Poland has been seriously challenging, leading many Polish investors to abandon

free cash flow in the quarter. They indicated
Rand Worldwide Inc. 5.8
they expect another strongly profitable
year in fiscal 2023. But the damage is done, Fitlife Brands Inc. 5.0
and what was formerly a nicely performing

investment now sits just below breakeven.
EACO Corp. 3.9
I can excuse a disappointing earnings
GEE Group Inc. 3.8
report, even if it was avoidable. We are
investing for what our companies will do in LICT Corporation 3.8
the years ahead, not the next quarter. What
Butler National Corp. 3.6
concerns me much more is GEE Group’s
failure to commit publicly to a capital Total, Top Ten 59.6%
allocation framework. The company has
been accumulating cash far in excess of its operating needs for several quarters now, yet it has
not chosen to reward shareholders with a return of capital or increase its earnings power with
acquisitions or internal initiatives. Back in December, the CEO promised the board would meet to
consider implementing a share buyback once earnings were “digested” by the market. He also
promised “good things” ahead. We’re still waiting. GEE Group will report to shareholders again
in just a few weeks. I expect a much-improved report and some answers on the capital allocation
question. These answers will determine whether GEE Group maintains its place in our portfolio.
With so many other great opportunities out there, there’s no room for a company that repeatedly
fails to deliver on its promises, no matter how optically cheap its shares may be.

Special Situations
Alluvial Fund’s special situations holdings contributed well to close out the year. Pegroco Invest
AB inches closer and closer to repaying the accrued dividends on its preferred shares. The firm
announced it would merge with another investment company with an eye toward an exchange
listing for its common shares in 2023. To pull this off, Pegroco will need to take the final step
toward cleaning up its capital structure by going fully current on its dividends.
We identified an attractive liquidation scenario in the fourth quarter: Retail Value Inc. “RVI” was
once the owner of numerous shopping centers across the USA. Now all these properties are sold
and RVI is just a cash shell that will pay off all remaining liabilities and distribute the remaining
proceeds over the next few years. I expect the distributions to be heavily weighted toward 2023
and 2024. As far as liquidations go, Retail Value is an especially clean situation. There are no
“squishy” assets of uncertain value. The company’s liabilities are well-defined and highly unlikely to
be re-estimated upwards. In fact, I believe the company is being quite conservative in its estimate
of the remaining liquidation expenses. When all is said and done, I expect to receive around 31
cents per share in liquidation proceeds, well
above our average cost of around 20 cents
TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/22 (%)
per share. Alluvial Fund is the owner of nearly
United States 74.9
1.7 million RVIC shares, equal to 7.9% of
the total outstanding. Our 13G filing (the Eurozone 13.2
fund’s first!) can be viewed here. A special

Currently, I am looking at another Swedish
preferred stock that I believe will resume
paying dividends in 2023. And in a few months, we will receive the final payment on a bankruptcy-
related royalty security I haven’t mentioned before due to my continued efforts to acquire more of
the exceptionally illiquid units. I continue to expect special situations investments to play a greater
role in the Alluvial Fund portfolio in the coming years.
New Holdings: Introducing Fitlife and Supremex
Alluvial Fund has a meaningful new holding in Fitlife Brands, a retailer of health and fitness
supplements. While the economics are good and the value is compelling, our investment is also
a “jockey” bet on Fitlife’s CEO and controlling shareholder, Dayton Judd. In past letters, I have
mentioned that within the ecosystem of micro-cap companies, there are a few individuals whose
every move is worthy of attention. Mr. Judd is one of those people. I first crossed paths with Mr.
Judd years ago when we were both invested in Otelco, an underperforming telecom provider.
We discussed various ways of achieving better outcomes for shareholders. Ultimately, I choose to
move on. Mr. Judd got himself appointed to the Otelco board of directors and, eventually, won
a reasonable outcome for shareholders despite Otelco being, in retrospect, a weakly-positioned
and capital-starved company. Following that, Mr. Judd moved on to new projects including Fitlife.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

Over time, Mr. Judd has built Fitlife by adding new brands and building new distribution channels,
including a healthy e-commerce presence. The returns have been phenomenal. So good, I kick
myself for not casting our lot in with Fitlife earlier.
Presently, Fitlife operates through 9 different brands. The various products are meant to aid
bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts in building muscle and burning fat—think whey protein,
creatine, amino acids, pre and post workout shakes, etc. Not my thing, but people swear by
this stuff and Fitlife’s customers give it rave reviews. The biggest distribution channel for Fitlife’s
products is GNC stores, but the company has been working hard to increase sales through Amazon
and direct through its website.
For the 12 trailing months, Fitlife recorded revenue of $31.2 million, operating income of $6.5
million, and net income of $5.2 million. The company has $14.9 million in cash and no debt. At the
current share price, this works out to 14.3x earnings, or 11.2x earnings backing out the company’s
cash. This is a reasonable valuation for a fast-growing, highly profitable, well-managed firm, but
the story is about to get a lot more compelling. Fitlife has agreed to buy Mimi’s Rock, a Canadian
health foods retailer. While Mimi’s Rock managed to build multiple successful brands, it has long
been burdened with excessive overhead and an over-leveraged balance sheet–both problems that
Mr. Judd can address. The acquisition will double Fitlife’s annual revenue and increase its operating
income by at least 50%. Fitlife will fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and
a moderate amount of low-cost debt, which it expects to pay down completely within a year.
Once the acquisition has been completed and the new brands integrated with Fitlife’s platform, I
expect the transaction to increase Fitlife’s earnings by more than 50%. Beyond the purely financial,
this acquisition will also reduce Fitlife’s dependence on GNC, cutting GNC sales from two-thirds
of revenue to one-third. E-commerce will become a much more substantial portion of Fitlife’s
distribution.
The Mimi’s Rock acquisition is a big step, but I know Mr. Judd has plenty more building to do. I am
excited to be along for the ride.
Like Fitlife Brands, we have also been looking northward for opportunities. A second new holding
I’d like to mention is Supremex Inc., a manufacturer of envelopes and packaging materials with
operations in Canada and the US. Over time, Supremex has built its envelope business, both
organically and through acquisitions, to the point where it now occupies a dominant position
in the Canadian market. Envelopes are certainly not a growth market—I may have finally found
something less exciting than rural telecoms!—but the expected perpetual decline here all but
guarantees that nobody will attempt to build a new envelope manufacturing facility. Supremex
is essentially the “last man standing” in a declining industry, the result of which is pricing power.
Indeed, the selling price of Supremex’s envelopes was up 30% year-over-year in the third quarter
without any noticeable effect on the volume of sales. Some of the price increase was due to
inflationary pressures, but the increase more than compensated for increased raw materials costs,
allowing Supremex to earn record margins.
Supremex is aware that the envelope market is in decline and is dedicating its cash flow and
acquisition efforts toward the growing packaging market. Packaging has been a hot area
due to the steady growth of online retail and the movement away from plastic toward more
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2022 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 7

environmentally friendly, recyclable paper and cardboard packaging. Just days ago, Supremex
announced the acquisition of Paragraph, a Quebec packaging producer. But Supremex isn’t just an
acquirer. Management also likes to reward shareholders with significant share buybacks and regular
dividends.
Despite its recent successes, the market still views Supremex as a dinosaur. Shares change hands at
just 6.5x trailing earnings, a ratio that is sure to fall once fourth quarter 2022 results are reported.
Looking ahead, the recent acquisitions of Paragraph and a small US envelope producer, Royal
Envelope, will further bolster results. Harvesting cash flows from a declining business to reinvest in
a more promising segment is not the easiest tightrope to walk, but so far, Supremex is managing
the transition with excellence.
I continue to enjoy searching for opportunities in the expert market. Any market where many can
sell but few can buy will regularly serve up chances to buy securities on incredibly attractive terms.
Near year-end, I was able to acquire shares of a deregistered structured product that holds long-
term debt issued by a giant investment-grade S&P 500 company. The underlying bonds trade at a
small premium to par, but the structured product, solely due to falling to the expert market, trades
at a 35% discount and yields >10%. Simply too good to pass up. A 10% rate of return is below our
usual return targets, but not when it can be achieved with little risk. There is a chance our ultimate
realized return could be higher if the security becomes exchange-traded again or if the issuer
tenders for the underlying debt or structured product units.
Concluding Thoughts
I am pleased with Alluvial Fund’s track record. Still, my responsibility as investment manager is to
improve, improve, improve. I have spent a lot of time this winter thinking about what has and has
not worked over our six-year history. More of the former, less of the latter. The next six years will be
better because I will be better.
I am thankful for the numerous partners who committed additional capital to the fund last year,
and to the many new partners who joined. I am also grateful for my associate, Tom Kapfer, who
contributed immensely to Alluvial’s research processes. Quarter after quarter, Tom edits these
missives into something almost readable.
We will soon begin the annual audit and tax reporting processes. Once again, we will work to
finalize each as quickly as possible to avoid causing undue delays in your tax preparation.
In the coming weeks, we will host a webinar to update partners on Alluvial Fund developments
and allow for questions and comments. Information will follow. In the meantime and as always, feel
free to contact me at any time. I thank you, as always, for the opportunity to manage your hard-
earned dollars. I will do all I can to grow your capital alongside mine in 2023.
Best Regards,
Dave Waters, CFA

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund closed out an excellent year on a quiet note, returning 0.5% in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, Alluvial Fund rose 31.0%, nearly double the returns of benchmarks. 2021 was the
finest year in Alluvial Fund’s history, the first in which our net return to limited partners exceeded
30%. This new year also marks a milestone for the fund: five full years of operations! This milestone
leads me to contemplate both the fund’s history and its future. I am proud of many of the
investments we have made and the processes we used to identify them. A few others…well, at
least they were learning opportunities. Above all, I am as dedicated as ever to the pursuit of that
next great idea. Thank you for entrusting your capital to Alluvial. Our best years are ahead.

As I write, markets are experiencing fear and consternation over the specter of prolonged inflation,
rising interest rates, and the deflation of the massive bubble in unprofitable technology companies
and highly speculative offerings. As is typically the case, our collection of obscurities and misfits is
weathering the storm quite well. I don’t know if markets will regain their confidence or if this is the
beginning of a deeper drawdown. Whatever may come to pass, I will say I am excited both by our
present portfolio and by the opportunities I see to invest in new holdings. The more markets fall,
the more excited I will become.
Portfolio Updates
P10, Inc. remains the fund’s largest holding. The company’s latest achievement is successfully
refinancing its debt, lowering the interest rate from 7.00% to 2.25% and extending the term. This
new agreement provides P10 with plenty of available capital to pursue its acquisitions strategy
and build its stable of alternative investment managers. Assets under management should soon
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

exceed $17 billion, with a clear path to $20 billion and higher. P10’s only disappointing aspect has
been its lackluster share price movement since its IPO. Despite its peerless cash flow profile and
predictability, growth options, and management skill and alignment, shares continue to change
hands at just 17x my estimate of current free cash flow. I remind myself that though P10 is now an
NYSE-listed company, the value of its free-floating stock is just $260 million. For trading purposes,
P10 is still just a micro-cap. It should be no surprise that it acts like one.
I expect the market to change its assessment of P10 in the course of the year as the firm reports
growing assets under management and perhaps an acquisition or two. P10’s story has been one of
remarkable speed and agility. The firm’s rapid development makes quarter-to-quarter comparisons
of little use. With so much change, it’s no surprise that the market occasionally falls behind, failing
to appreciate the ongoing transformation. If we do end up in a bearish market environment, there
is a lot to be said for a company that knows what its revenues will be almost down to the penny for
years to come.
For the second year running, Crawford United celebrated the new year with acquisitions. This
time around, Crawford spent $4 million to acquire Florida-based Reverso Pumps and Separ of
the Americas. Assuming a purchase multiple of 6x EBIT, the acquisitions will increase Crawford’s
earnings by 15 cents per share. While individually they may seem small, the continued acquisition
of quality niche industrial companies adds up to major growth in Crawford United’s earnings
power. I expect the company’s results to feel some short-term pressure from supply chain troubles
and inflation, but I like what the company is building. I am confident that Crawford’s earnings will
exceed $10 per share at some point in the next decade and its shares will rise accordingly.
Garrett Motion is also feeling the effects of the troubles with global supply chains. Difficulties in
sourcing semiconductors have led many large automotive manufacturers to slow production, which
in turn delays orders for Garrett Motion’s turbochargers. Still, the environment has not prevented
Garrett Motion from making progress on improving its balance sheet and beginning to return
capital. In November, the company announced a plan to repurchase $100 million in common and
preferred stock. Then in December, Garrett Motion announced it would accelerate the planned
redemption of its Series B preferred stock held by Honeywell. By this time next year, Garrett
Motion will have meaningfully reduced its liabilities and bought in quite a bit of stock at a very
attractive price. As supply chains normalize, the company’s earnings and cash flow will benefit,
giving the company the ability to return more capital to shareholders and invest in the transition to
products for electric vehicles.
We are still awaiting the results of LICT Corporation’s strategic review. The announcement of
any decision on strategic alternatives was likely delayed by the company’s participation in FCC
Auction 110, in which LICT successfully bid on $7.7 million in mid-band spectrum to support its
wireless offerings. With the auction over, I look forward to news from the company. Even if the
result of the process is a decision to maintain the status quo, LICT’s status as a provider of essential
communications infrastructure and its commitment to returning capital make its shares attractive in
the mid-$20,000s.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

On the topic of essential communications infrastructure, I could not be more excited about
Unidata! For the first time, Unidata has laid out its 2022-2024 strategic plan, projecting 2024
revenues of EUR 64-79 million and EBITDA of EUR 19.1-23.3 million. At the mid-point of these
projections, Unidata currently trades for just 6 times 2024 EBITDA, a gigantic discount to
competitor valuations and to fair value using a common-sense free cash flow-based approach.
These are ambitious targets, but they are achievable. Unidata’s strong, recurring cash flow will
enable it to invest $40 million in its fiber network from 2022 to 2024 without taking on debt. This
extended network will allow Unidata to offer its broadband services to thousands upon thousands
of new customers, both residential and enterprise. Doubling revenues from 2021 to 2024 will
require Unidata to expand its offerings to adjacent products and services like data centers and
internet of things applications, but the demand is there. Unidata richly deserves its position as
Alluvial Fund’s second-largest holding.
A New Market, A New Holding
I spent a lot of time in 2021 investigating a new market: Poland. I came away extremely impressed
by the average quality and the sheer number of firms listed there. This is one of the most dynamic
European markets, but US investors seem to be entirely unaware. The Warsaw Exchange offers an
embarrassment of riches. There are scores of wonderful small companies listed there, all of them
highly profitable and growing. Most feature strong balance sheets and high insider ownership. The
best part is that they can often be bought at single digit multiples of earnings and/or cash flow.
I spent weeks and weeks researching several Polish companies, ultimately selecting a few of the
best for our portfolio. I am thrilled with the potential of these companies, and even more pleased
with how little we are paying for that potential.
Now, it must be noted that unique risks accompany investing in places like Poland, where a testy
relationship with the European Union and saber-rattling from the East promise no shortage of
political ups and downs. Because of these risks, Polish stocks will make up only a small percentage
of the fund’s assets regardless of their prospective returns. However, in several ways, the current
Polish market reminds me of the market for small Italian companies a few years ago. Many traded
extraordinarily cheaply due to inattention and perceived political and economic risk. We were able
to take full advantage of this environment in Italy, from which came Intred and Unidata, two of our
most successful investments to date.
With these thoughts in mind, it’s time to formally introduce one of our newest holdings. TIM SA
is a distributor of electrical components with a fast-growing third-party logistics (“3PL”) business.
TIM has grown revenues at a 14% annual pace since 2016, accelerating recently as e-commerce
takes off in Poland. The company worked hard to transition its business model to online sales over
the last several years and wound up creating the 3PL segment almost unintentionally. As its online
business grew, TIM found it could use excess warehouse space to fulfill online orders on behalf
of other Polish companies. Today, more than half of TIM SA’s 3PL revenues come from external
clients, including blue chips like IKEA. TIM SA is taking steps to accelerate the growth of the
3PL business and highlight its value by preparing to offer a portion of the business on the stock
exchange. In my view, the fast-growing, highly profitable 3PL business is worth more than 70% of
TIM SA’s current market capitalization.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

TIM SA’s business benefited from COVID, but the growth has not slowed even as COVID has
receded. In December 2021, revenues were up 22.6% year over year. Strong operating leverage
caused third quarter profits to rise 156% versus 2020. Despite TIM SA’s remarkable growth profile
and upcoming IPO catalyst, shares trade at just 10x trailing earnings. The planned 3PL IPO is
scheduled to take place in the first half of 2022.
Special Situations: A Quick Conclusion
One of our special situations, Hexion Holdings, paid off in the fourth quarter, agreeing to be
acquired by a private equity firm. Hexion was a classic Alluvial holding: little-known, illiquid,
and boring. Then again, one person’s “boring” is another’s “fascinating.” I never found Hexion’s
chemical products all that interesting, but I
did respect their critical role in the production
of ubiquitous products like plywood and TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 12/31/21 (%)
particleboard. (On the flip side, I understand P10 Holdings Inc. 14.6
others may view my beloved rural telecom
Unidata S.p.A. 11.5
networks as just a bunch of lonely cables.)
When we first purchased shares a few months LICT Corporation 6.4
ago, Hexion’s business was recovering from
Crawford United Corp. 5.7
a cyclical downturn and the company had
announced a plan to spin off its lower-margin, Garrett Motion Inc. 4.8
commodity business to shareholders and list
Rand Worldwide Inc. 4.6
its higher-quality operations on the NYSE.
I pegged the combined value of the two Intred S.p.A. 4.1
entities in the lower $30s/share. In the end,
Undisclosed Prof. Services Company 3.8
the plan changed. Hexion agreed to sell
its epoxy business (the planned spin-off) to TIM S.A. 3.8
Westlake Chemical. I bought more shares
Butler National Corp. 3.7
when the epoxy sale was announced, figuring
the company was one step closer to a stock Total, Top Ten 62.9
market debut or other transaction.
It didn’t take long. Hexion reached a deal with American Securities to acquire the remaining
businesses for $30/share. The ultimate sale price came in a little lower than I had hoped, but I
understand the company’s decision not to chance an IPO. A chemicals company could have a
tough time igniting investor imaginations in an IPO ecosystem dominated by SPACs and hyper-
growth tech companies. Hexion’s acquirer will not face antitrust or financing issues. However,
because this is a two-part deal with American Securities’ purchase contingent on Westlake buying
the epoxy business, I judged $28.50 as a fair discount to deal value and sold our shares a couple of
days into the new year. We realized gains of 12-35% on our various purchases. Would that all our
special situations worked out so quickly and cleanly!
A New Path Ahead
At its inception in 2017, Alluvial Fund took on a seed investment from Willow Oak Asset
Management, LLC. In return for its sizable investment in the fund, Willow Oak was entitled to a
percentage of the fees generated by the fund. Willow Oak provided some marketing support, but
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

otherwise was not involved in the fund’s day-to-day operations or investment process and had no
ownership in the fund’s general partner, Alluvial Capital Management, LLC (My company, of which I
own 100%.)
Time marches on and business needs change. As of year-end, we no longer have a seeding
relationship with Willow Oak. For various business and regulatory reasons, Willow Oak decided to
cease making direct investments in nascent investment funds and has withdrawn all its capital from
Alluvial Fund. I always enjoyed my interactions with Willow Oak staff and I wish them all the best as
we move forward independently.
Willow Oak’s redemption leaves Alluvial Fund with a much more diversified set of limited partners.
At March 31, 2021, Willow Oak’s investment represented 44% of the fund’s total capital. Today,
no single partner represents more than 7% of the fund’s assets. I prefer it this way. With over 60
limited partners and a median LP investment of just under $300,000, we have a highly stable
capital base that enables us to invest in the
often esoteric, off-the-run securities that offer TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/21 (%)
incredible value. Going forward, I intend to
United States 65.4
limit the size of any potential investments by
new LPs in order to maintain this advantage. Eurozone 19.0
As always, the entirety of my family’s
Poland 7.9
investable assets is in Alluvial Fund, and I
sleep well. Sweden 6.5
Other 1.2
Being fully independent once more feels
good. Alluvial Capital launched in 2014 Total 100%
with no institutional capital or cornerstone
investors, just me in my cheap little Pittsburgh row house apartment and a handful of clients willing
to take a shot with a young, unproven investment manager. (And for those clients, I am forever
grateful!) Charting our own course is familiar territory.
Thank you for your confidence in Alluvial. As always, I appreciate the opportunity to manage
capital on your behalf. I know your investment represents years of hard work and prudent
investing, and I will do my utmost to be a responsible steward of that legacy.
Other Updates
We have welcomed a number of new limited partners lately. Hello! You are in good company. I
have always strived to manage Alluvial Fund in a way that attracts the like-minded: people who are
unafraid to invest well off the beaten path, with the patience to stick with investments that might
take years to pay off. I am happy to see more and more of these people commit to Alluvial Fund.
However, there is a limit to how much capital a strategy like ours can accommodate. We are not
close yet, but when the day comes, Alluvial Fund will close to new entrants.
The annual audit process has commenced and will soon begin working on tax reporting. As in
years past, I will work closely with the fund’s administrator to deliver K-1 statements as early as
possible, ideally by mid-March.

Dear Partners,
Alluvial Fund closed out an excellent year on a quiet note, returning 0.5% in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, Alluvial Fund rose 31.0%, nearly double the returns of benchmarks. 2021 was the
finest year in Alluvial Fund’s history, the first in which our net return to limited partners exceeded
30%. This new year also marks a milestone for the fund: five full years of operations! This milestone
leads me to contemplate both the fund’s history and its future. I am proud of many of the
investments we have made and the processes we used to identify them. A few others…well, at
least they were learning opportunities. Above all, I am as dedicated as ever to the pursuit of that
next great idea. Thank you for entrusting your capital to Alluvial. Our best years are ahead.

As I write, markets are experiencing fear and consternation over the specter of prolonged inflation,
rising interest rates, and the deflation of the massive bubble in unprofitable technology companies
and highly speculative offerings. As is typically the case, our collection of obscurities and misfits is
weathering the storm quite well. I don’t know if markets will regain their confidence or if this is the
beginning of a deeper drawdown. Whatever may come to pass, I will say I am excited both by our
present portfolio and by the opportunities I see to invest in new holdings. The more markets fall,
the more excited I will become.
Portfolio Updates
P10, Inc. remains the fund’s largest holding. The company’s latest achievement is successfully
refinancing its debt, lowering the interest rate from 7.00% to 2.25% and extending the term. This
new agreement provides P10 with plenty of available capital to pursue its acquisitions strategy
and build its stable of alternative investment managers. Assets under management should soon
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 3

exceed $17 billion, with a clear path to $20 billion and higher. P10’s only disappointing aspect has
been its lackluster share price movement since its IPO. Despite its peerless cash flow profile and
predictability, growth options, and management skill and alignment, shares continue to change
hands at just 17x my estimate of current free cash flow. I remind myself that though P10 is now an
NYSE-listed company, the value of its free-floating stock is just $260 million. For trading purposes,
P10 is still just a micro-cap. It should be no surprise that it acts like one.
I expect the market to change its assessment of P10 in the course of the year as the firm reports
growing assets under management and perhaps an acquisition or two. P10’s story has been one of
remarkable speed and agility. The firm’s rapid development makes quarter-to-quarter comparisons
of little use. With so much change, it’s no surprise that the market occasionally falls behind, failing
to appreciate the ongoing transformation. If we do end up in a bearish market environment, there
is a lot to be said for a company that knows what its revenues will be almost down to the penny for
years to come.
For the second year running, Crawford United celebrated the new year with acquisitions. This
time around, Crawford spent $4 million to acquire Florida-based Reverso Pumps and Separ of
the Americas. Assuming a purchase multiple of 6x EBIT, the acquisitions will increase Crawford’s
earnings by 15 cents per share. While individually they may seem small, the continued acquisition
of quality niche industrial companies adds up to major growth in Crawford United’s earnings
power. I expect the company’s results to feel some short-term pressure from supply chain troubles
and inflation, but I like what the company is building. I am confident that Crawford’s earnings will
exceed $10 per share at some point in the next decade and its shares will rise accordingly.
Garrett Motion is also feeling the effects of the troubles with global supply chains. Difficulties in
sourcing semiconductors have led many large automotive manufacturers to slow production, which
in turn delays orders for Garrett Motion’s turbochargers. Still, the environment has not prevented
Garrett Motion from making progress on improving its balance sheet and beginning to return
capital. In November, the company announced a plan to repurchase $100 million in common and
preferred stock. Then in December, Garrett Motion announced it would accelerate the planned
redemption of its Series B preferred stock held by Honeywell. By this time next year, Garrett
Motion will have meaningfully reduced its liabilities and bought in quite a bit of stock at a very
attractive price. As supply chains normalize, the company’s earnings and cash flow will benefit,
giving the company the ability to return more capital to shareholders and invest in the transition to
products for electric vehicles.
We are still awaiting the results of LICT Corporation’s strategic review. The announcement of
any decision on strategic alternatives was likely delayed by the company’s participation in FCC
Auction 110, in which LICT successfully bid on $7.7 million in mid-band spectrum to support its
wireless offerings. With the auction over, I look forward to news from the company. Even if the
result of the process is a decision to maintain the status quo, LICT’s status as a provider of essential
communications infrastructure and its commitment to returning capital make its shares attractive in
the mid-$20,000s.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 4

On the topic of essential communications infrastructure, I could not be more excited about
Unidata! For the first time, Unidata has laid out its 2022-2024 strategic plan, projecting 2024
revenues of EUR 64-79 million and EBITDA of EUR 19.1-23.3 million. At the mid-point of these
projections, Unidata currently trades for just 6 times 2024 EBITDA, a gigantic discount to
competitor valuations and to fair value using a common-sense free cash flow-based approach.
These are ambitious targets, but they are achievable. Unidata’s strong, recurring cash flow will
enable it to invest $40 million in its fiber network from 2022 to 2024 without taking on debt. This
extended network will allow Unidata to offer its broadband services to thousands upon thousands
of new customers, both residential and enterprise. Doubling revenues from 2021 to 2024 will
require Unidata to expand its offerings to adjacent products and services like data centers and
internet of things applications, but the demand is there. Unidata richly deserves its position as
Alluvial Fund’s second-largest holding.
A New Market, A New Holding
I spent a lot of time in 2021 investigating a new market: Poland. I came away extremely impressed
by the average quality and the sheer number of firms listed there. This is one of the most dynamic
European markets, but US investors seem to be entirely unaware. The Warsaw Exchange offers an
embarrassment of riches. There are scores of wonderful small companies listed there, all of them
highly profitable and growing. Most feature strong balance sheets and high insider ownership. The
best part is that they can often be bought at single digit multiples of earnings and/or cash flow.
I spent weeks and weeks researching several Polish companies, ultimately selecting a few of the
best for our portfolio. I am thrilled with the potential of these companies, and even more pleased
with how little we are paying for that potential.
Now, it must be noted that unique risks accompany investing in places like Poland, where a testy
relationship with the European Union and saber-rattling from the East promise no shortage of
political ups and downs. Because of these risks, Polish stocks will make up only a small percentage
of the fund’s assets regardless of their prospective returns. However, in several ways, the current
Polish market reminds me of the market for small Italian companies a few years ago. Many traded
extraordinarily cheaply due to inattention and perceived political and economic risk. We were able
to take full advantage of this environment in Italy, from which came Intred and Unidata, two of our
most successful investments to date.
With these thoughts in mind, it’s time to formally introduce one of our newest holdings. TIM SA
is a distributor of electrical components with a fast-growing third-party logistics (“3PL”) business.
TIM has grown revenues at a 14% annual pace since 2016, accelerating recently as e-commerce
takes off in Poland. The company worked hard to transition its business model to online sales over
the last several years and wound up creating the 3PL segment almost unintentionally. As its online
business grew, TIM found it could use excess warehouse space to fulfill online orders on behalf
of other Polish companies. Today, more than half of TIM SA’s 3PL revenues come from external
clients, including blue chips like IKEA. TIM SA is taking steps to accelerate the growth of the
3PL business and highlight its value by preparing to offer a portion of the business on the stock
exchange. In my view, the fast-growing, highly profitable 3PL business is worth more than 70% of
TIM SA’s current market capitalization.
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 5

TIM SA’s business benefited from COVID, but the growth has not slowed even as COVID has
receded. In December 2021, revenues were up 22.6% year over year. Strong operating leverage
caused third quarter profits to rise 156% versus 2020. Despite TIM SA’s remarkable growth profile
and upcoming IPO catalyst, shares trade at just 10x trailing earnings. The planned 3PL IPO is
scheduled to take place in the first half of 2022.
Special Situations: A Quick Conclusion
One of our special situations, Hexion Holdings, paid off in the fourth quarter, agreeing to be
acquired by a private equity firm. Hexion was a classic Alluvial holding: little-known, illiquid,
and boring. Then again, one person’s “boring” is another’s “fascinating.” I never found Hexion’s
chemical products all that interesting, but I
did respect their critical role in the production
of ubiquitous products like plywood and TABLE II: Top Ten Holdings, 12/31/21 (%)
particleboard. (On the flip side, I understand P10 Holdings Inc. 14.6
others may view my beloved rural telecom
Unidata S.p.A. 11.5
networks as just a bunch of lonely cables.)
When we first purchased shares a few months LICT Corporation 6.4
ago, Hexion’s business was recovering from
Crawford United Corp. 5.7
a cyclical downturn and the company had
announced a plan to spin off its lower-margin, Garrett Motion Inc. 4.8
commodity business to shareholders and list
Rand Worldwide Inc. 4.6
its higher-quality operations on the NYSE.
I pegged the combined value of the two Intred S.p.A. 4.1
entities in the lower $30s/share. In the end,
Undisclosed Prof. Services Company 3.8
the plan changed. Hexion agreed to sell
its epoxy business (the planned spin-off) to TIM S.A. 3.8
Westlake Chemical. I bought more shares
Butler National Corp. 3.7
when the epoxy sale was announced, figuring
the company was one step closer to a stock Total, Top Ten 62.9
market debut or other transaction.
It didn’t take long. Hexion reached a deal with American Securities to acquire the remaining
businesses for $30/share. The ultimate sale price came in a little lower than I had hoped, but I
understand the company’s decision not to chance an IPO. A chemicals company could have a
tough time igniting investor imaginations in an IPO ecosystem dominated by SPACs and hyper-
growth tech companies. Hexion’s acquirer will not face antitrust or financing issues. However,
because this is a two-part deal with American Securities’ purchase contingent on Westlake buying
the epoxy business, I judged $28.50 as a fair discount to deal value and sold our shares a couple of
days into the new year. We realized gains of 12-35% on our various purchases. Would that all our
special situations worked out so quickly and cleanly!
A New Path Ahead
At its inception in 2017, Alluvial Fund took on a seed investment from Willow Oak Asset
Management, LLC. In return for its sizable investment in the fund, Willow Oak was entitled to a
percentage of the fees generated by the fund. Willow Oak provided some marketing support, but
Alluvial Capital Management, LLC Q4 2021 Letter to Limited Partners | p. 6

otherwise was not involved in the fund’s day-to-day operations or investment process and had no
ownership in the fund’s general partner, Alluvial Capital Management, LLC (My company, of which I
own 100%.)
Time marches on and business needs change. As of year-end, we no longer have a seeding
relationship with Willow Oak. For various business and regulatory reasons, Willow Oak decided to
cease making direct investments in nascent investment funds and has withdrawn all its capital from
Alluvial Fund. I always enjoyed my interactions with Willow Oak staff and I wish them all the best as
we move forward independently.
Willow Oak’s redemption leaves Alluvial Fund with a much more diversified set of limited partners.
At March 31, 2021, Willow Oak’s investment represented 44% of the fund’s total capital. Today,
no single partner represents more than 7% of the fund’s assets. I prefer it this way. With over 60
limited partners and a median LP investment of just under $300,000, we have a highly stable
capital base that enables us to invest in the
often esoteric, off-the-run securities that offer TABLE III: World Allocation, 12/31/21 (%)
incredible value. Going forward, I intend to
United States 65.4
limit the size of any potential investments by
new LPs in order to maintain this advantage. Eurozone 19.0
As always, the entirety of my family’s
Poland 7.9
investable assets is in Alluvial Fund, and I
sleep well. Sweden 6.5
Other 1.2
Being fully independent once more feels
good. Alluvial Capital launched in 2014 Total 100%
with no institutional capital or cornerstone
investors, just me in my cheap little Pittsburgh row house apartment and a handful of clients willing
to take a shot with a young, unproven investment manager. (And for those clients, I am forever
grateful!) Charting our own course is familiar territory.
Thank you for your confidence in Alluvial. As always, I appreciate the opportunity to manage
capital on your behalf. I know your investment represents years of hard work and prudent
investing, and I will do my utmost to be a responsible steward of that legacy.
Other Updates
We have welcomed a number of new limited partners lately. Hello! You are in good company. I
have always strived to manage Alluvial Fund in a way that attracts the like-minded: people who are
unafraid to invest well off the beaten path, with the patience to stick with investments that might
take years to pay off. I am happy to see more and more of these people commit to Alluvial Fund.
However, there is a limit to how much capital a strategy like ours can accommodate. We are not
close yet, but when the day comes, Alluvial Fund will close to new entrants.
The annual audit process has commenced and will soon begin working on tax reporting. As in
years past, I will work closely with the fund’s administrator to deliver K-1 statements as early as
possible, ideally by mid-March.

"Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd.",Daniel S. Loeb,"April 30, 2025",2025.0,1.0,-3.7,S&P 500,-4.3,0.5999999999999996,"The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Master Fund LP in a master-feeder structure. Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Master Fund LP inclusive of legacy private investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable. Sector and geographic categories are determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period. The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

ANNUALIZED NET Q11 RETURN2 TP OFFSHORE FUND, LTD. -3.7% 13.0% CS HF EVENT-DRIVEN INDEX 0.7% 6.8% S&P 500 INDEX (TR) -4.3% 9.3% MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR) -1.7% 7.7% 1 Through March 31, 2025. 2 Annualized Return from inception (December 1996 for TP Offshore and quoted indices). PLEASE SEE THE NEW SERIES RETURNS AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT. The top five winners for the quarter were Meta Platforms Inc., Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., Phoenix Holdings Ltd., and Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding hedges, were Pacific Gas and Electric Co., TSMC, Carvana Co., Amazon.com Inc., and Danaher Corp. Review and Outlook The First Quarter began with investor optimism about the new administration’s expected plans for deregulation, improved tax and energy policy, reduced government waste via “DOGE”, and a business-friendly environment. By quarter’s end, concerns about trade policy – reaching a climax with the seemingly incoherent tariff schedule released on an unironically dubbed “Liberation Day” in the beginning of April – had turned market sentiment decidedly negative. Over the past few weeks, the administration seems to have mitigated some of its more aggressive tariff objectives in what we hope is part of its “Art of the Deal” negotiating approach, however the slowdown in deal-making, financing, and general economic activity continues. As of today, we await details of any individual trade deals and are working with a wide spectrum of possible economic and market outcomes until negotiations yield tangible results. We realized gains earlier in the year through opportunistic sales near the highs in Meta and Apollo. We subsequently re-entered Apollo towards the lows in March. We sold or reduced several other positions throughout Q1 and into Q2 that took our gross and net exposures to multi-year lows, giving us dry powder to deploy at the right time. While not unscathed, our overall net year-to-date losses in the Offshore Fund are less than the S&P’s, and we feel we are well positioned in several new names for the current environment. We increased our investments in event-driven, activist, and risk arbitrage positions that we believe will perform well in a choppier market environment due to their catalyst-oriented nature, and reduced exposure to numerous market-sensitive positions, largely in the tech and consumer sectors. We have a meaningful investment in U.S. Steel, which we believe will complete its planned merger with Nippon Steel based on the industrial logic behind the combination, and benefits to “America First” re-industrialization plans. We have a previously disclosed position in CoStar, where we recently reached a settlement with the company, which we discuss below. Portfolio Updates Equities: CoStar Group CoStar is the leading vendor of real estate technology, often referred to as the “Bloomberg of commercial real estate”. The company’s portfolio includes data and software products (the “CoStar Suite”) and digital marketing platforms (LoopNet, Apartments.com). We have long admired this collection of franchises, which provide the real estate industry with mission-critical data, software, and services that are designed into workflows and function as a system of reference. They hold dominant market share, have low TAM penetration with a long runway for future growth, have significant untapped pricing power, and enjoy high-margin business models with ample room for further margin expansion. These attributes have allowed CoStar’s core business to compound EBITDA at a 20% CAGR over the past ten years, a level which we expect to sustain going forward. Despite the continued strength of its core business, we believe recent capital allocation decisions have derailed CoStar’s compounding algorithm. Over the past five years, management has increasingly focused on leveraging CoStar’s dominance in commercial real estate (CRE) to expand into residential real estate (RRE). The primary vehicle for this expansion has been its nascent Homes.com business, which aims to supplant Zillow as the leading digital marketplace for home sales in the U.S. In pursuit of that goal, we estimate that CoStar is spending almost $1 billion annually on growth investments (and will have spent more than $3 billion cumulatively by the end of this year), but this investment has yet to generate meaningful revenue. Expanding losses at Homes.com have obscured rapid growth in the core business and reduced consolidated EBITDA by approximately 80%. The market is increasingly questioning the magnitude and duration of future losses, and investment performance has stagnated. After compounding at a ~25% IRR for two decades following its IPO, the stock has now been flat for more than five years, underperforming indices and peers by wide margins. After several years of uncertainty, we believe it is time for CoStar to begin the journey of meaningful self-help. During the first quarter, we engaged with the company and its founder and CEO, Andy Florance, with the goal of helping the company improve its capital allocation framework. CoStar agreed to add three new directors (all of whom have deep capital allocation experience), create a Capital Allocation Committee of its Board of Directors tasked with establishing a rigorous framework for future capital deployment, including that of Homes.com, and review its executive compensation programs to ensure management’s incentives remain aligned with stockholder value creation. Third Point has signed a standstill agreement that lasts for less than one year, and while results will not be immediate, we expect to see a meaningful improvement in capital allocation by YE 2025. As CoStar’s core business continues to compound value and improved capital allocation starts to narrow the losses at Homes.com, we believe the company can grow EBITDA by a factor of >7x over the next few years, setting the stage for the stock to regain its star status. Corporate Credit Credit markets were relatively strong the first two months of 2025, supported by light net new issuance and the sharp decline in interest rates. These gains round-tripped in March as concerning tariff rhetoric began to crystallize into action. Our corporate credit portfolio was up marginally on a gross basis in Q1 but declined by about 30 basis points on a net basis. Following quarter-end, the market suffered its most violent selloff since Covid from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, and while some losses were recouped, we expect volatility to remain extremely elevated. Even before the tariff tantrum, our thesis was that consumer weakness and persistent inflation would cause more dislocations this year, and thus more opportunities for us. While any long exposure feels like too much in a decline such as the “Liberation Day” purge, we believe our credit book is in very good shape. As always, we are invested in relatively liquid names with larger capitalizations that we believe give these companies more levers to pull when the capital markets become difficult. We run the portfolio without leverage and our industry positioning is weighted in defensive sectors. That said, in indiscriminate panics, in our view, what you own is not as important as who else owns it. We have taken marks in some positions that tend to have more hedge fund-oriented holders. Credits that are rumored to be heavily owned by the highly leveraged multi-manager platforms have been whacked particularly hard. This is the first selloff where this technical has contributed to meaningful volatility and we expect to take advantage of these dislocations going forward. We expect to see many compelling opportunities in the months ahead as the market digests the tariff impact on leveraged borrowers. This current selloff is unique: it is self-inflicted, but we expect it will offer bargains like all other dislocations. We have a long track record of capitalizing on these opportunities in corporate credit. While we have lost money coming into these periods, we have made it back severalfold on the back end. There have been five major dislocations in our book since 2008. Even excluding post-GFC performance of over +100%, our average two-year compound returns after these selloffs were +52% gross (45% net). While corporate credit is just a portion of the total strategy, we have taken up our exposure during these periods and expect to find compelling opportunities to add to the portfolio in the coming weeks. Structured Credit Structured Credit returned +1.5% gross (1.1% net) in the first quarter. Our portfolio is predominately composed of fixed-rate residential mortgages (74%), in addition to consumer asset-backed securities (20%) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (6%). During Q1, we saw treasuries rally 40bps and credit spreads tighten through February, which provided a tailwind to our predominately fixed rate portfolio. In March, we saw the lagged effect of broader equity volatility as credit spreads slowly widened in tandem with Treasury yields going lower. With heightened market volatility expected to continue, we see a few themes emerging in structured credit: 1) We believe the rate rally is constructive for U.S. residential mortgages. We refinanced 12 reperforming mortgage securitizations despite interest rates moving 50bps higher in 2024. Fixed rate loans backed by U.S. homes are a credit defensive asset class during a rate rally, in our view. While we may experience credit spread widening, we believe there will be a credit preference for U.S. mortgages where borrowers have more than 50% equity in their homes and are locked into a fixed rate. A potential Fed rate cut or this Treasury range (even with an offsetting credit widening) should create an opportunity for underlying mortgages to rally. If we saw a 20% decline in house prices, the loan-to-values of mortgages would still be around 62.5%, creating a cushion for potential defaults. As credit markets dislocate, we believe there will be a credit tiering and preference for first lien, owner occupied, residential exposure based on credit fundamentals and longer duration capital specifically raised for this market sector. 2) We believe subprime consumers will continue to weaken. We have expressed concerns about subprime auto exposure in the past, as we saw borrowers pay up for cars in 2021 and 2022 and start strategically defaulting this year as refinancing options became scarce, and values were inflated. With additional macro headwinds, subprime consumers are vulnerable, with savings rates declining in the face of rising unemployment. We do not have subprime auto exposure, and our subprime unsecured and credit card exposure is in loan form or at the senior part of the capital structure. 3) In our view, trading opportunities in credit are starting. While equity repriced, credit markets were slower to respond but we are seeing the first signs of credit concerns within CLOs. In March, we saw CLO mezzanine tranches move into the high single digit to low double digit yield context. Moving forward, we anticipate a decline in dollar prices. As we collaborate across Third Point’s credit teams, we are identifying loan issuers and sectors with more exposure to a protectionist trade policy. The first stage is that loan prices are declining a few points from par, and more distressed loans are down 10 points. The second stage is when some CLO managers look to reduce exposure as loans get closer to $80. While CLOs are non-mark-to-market vehicles, when the loans fall below $80 or get downgraded to CCC or below, the loans are carried at the prevailing market price instead of par. This structural feature within CLOs can create selling pressure on leveraged loans and subsequent pressure on CLO debt tranche pricing. As an example, when oil prices sold off in 2016, CLO BBs dropped 20-30 points in a few weeks, creating a buying opportunity that generated two years of mid-teens returns. We are constructive that this market volatility will present compelling investing opportunities in credit. While significant capital has been raised for locked-up funds, we believe the credit market will be more attractive for tactical investors like Third Point who can provide liquidity as the uncertainty persists. Business Updates Birch Grove Integration & Private Credit Launch In February, we completed our acquisition of Birch Grove, a diversified credit asset manager. Integrating Birch Grove into Third Point brought over $8 billion of new capital invested in mature collateralized loan obligations, private credit, and other strategies, as well as a talented and experienced team led by CEO/CIO Jonathan Berger. When I envisioned acquiring Birch Grove, I believed we could achieve meaningful synergies between our existing strategies and their businesses. I am pleased to say that we are off to a strong start. Our private credit effort, incubated since late 2023, expects to launch several different tailored strategies starting in Q2, including an insurance-dedicated vehicle as well as a strategy for which we recently filed a registration statement with the SEC. Chris Taylor, who leads our private credit effort, has vast experience in direct lending, with a deep network of sourcing and relationships, while Birch Grove’s strength in private credit is in solutions lending. Their experienced team has what we feel are equally deep relationships in the middle market solutions space. These teams have quickly combined to form Third Point Private Credit and are coming to market with a strategy that offers access to core middle market direct lending and capital solutions that will seek to provide investors with attractive current income, risk-adjusted returns, and portfolio diversification. Augmented by Third Point’s three-decade history investing in credit securities and institutional platform, these integrated businesses aim to offer a powerful combination: a strategy that can tailor a broad range of bespoke lending solutions for middle-market borrowers and create compelling returns for investors. They have already co-completed their first deal and have a robust pipeline. I believe that Third Point’s edge comes from our collaborative culture and ability to toggle between equities and credit depending on the market environment. We will celebrate on June 1 the 30th anniversary of the date in 1995 when we launched as a distressed debt fund, before evolving to include the many strategies we incorporate into the main fund portfolio today. Bringing more perspectives into the credit side of the business has already invigorated our views on credit opportunities. Birch Grove’s team of CLO analysts brings a wealth of knowledge about the debt profiles of individual companies and sectors and offer insights into our main fund equity research process. Combined with the significant track records and dedicated capital in our structured and corporate credit funds, our desire to offer our investors diversified solutions for their portfolios – in strategies ranging from the earliest stages of venture capital to our flagship hedge fund, to varying credit strategies, and our life and annuity reinsurer Malibu Re – is well underway. We look forward to sharing more about these exciting developments with you at our 30th Anniversary Investor Summit on May 29, 2025, in New York City. Sincerely, Daniel S.

Review and Outlook
The First Quarter began with investor optimism about the new administration’s expected
plans for deregulation, improved tax and energy policy, reduced government waste via
“DOGE”, and a business-friendly environment. By quarter’s end, concerns about trade policy
– reaching a climax with the seemingly incoherent tariff schedule released on an unironically
dubbed “Liberation Day” in the beginning of April – had turned market sentiment decidedly
negative. Over the past few weeks, the administration seems to have mitigated some of its
Page 1

more aggressive tariff objectives in what we hope is part of its “Art of the Deal” negotiating
approach, however the slowdown in deal-making, financing, and general economic activity
continues. As of today, we await details of any individual trade deals and are working with
a wide spectrum of possible economic and market outcomes until negotiations yield tangible
results.
We realized gains earlier in the year through opportunistic sales near the highs in Meta and
Apollo.1 We subsequently re-entered Apollo towards the lows in March. We sold or reduced
several other positions throughout Q1 and into Q2 that took our gross and net exposures to
multi-year lows, giving us dry powder to deploy at the right time. While not unscathed, our
overall net year-to-date losses in the Offshore Fund are less than the S&P’s, and we feel we
are well positioned in several new names for the current environment.
We increased our investments in event-driven, activist, and risk arbitrage positions that we
believe will perform well in a choppier market environment due to their catalyst-oriented
nature, and reduced exposure to numerous market-sensitive positions, largely in the tech
and consumer sectors. We have a meaningful investment in U.S. Steel, which we believe will
complete its planned merger with Nippon Steel based on the industrial logic behind the
combination, and benefits to “America First” re-industrialization plans. We have a
previously disclosed position in CoStar, where we recently reached a settlement with the
company, which we discuss below.

Portfolio Updates
Equities: CoStar Group
CoStar is the leading vendor of real estate technology, often referred to as the “Bloomberg of
commercial real estate”. The company’s portfolio includes data and software products (the
“CoStar Suite”) and digital marketing platforms (LoopNet, Apartments.com). We have long
admired this collection of franchises, which provide the real estate industry with mission-
critical data, software, and services that are designed into workflows and function as a
system of reference. They hold dominant market share, have low TAM penetration with a
long runway for future growth, have significant untapped pricing power, and enjoy high-
margin business models with ample room for further margin expansion. These attributes
have allowed CoStar’s core business to compound EBITDA at a 20% CAGR over the past ten
years, a level which we expect to sustain going forward.
Despite the continued strength of its core business, we believe recent capital allocation
decisions have derailed CoStar’s compounding algorithm. Over the past five years,
management has increasingly focused on leveraging CoStar’s dominance in commercial real
estate (CRE) to expand into residential real estate (RRE). The primary vehicle for this
expansion has been its nascent Homes.com business, which aims to supplant Zillow as the
leading digital marketplace for home sales in the U.S. In pursuit of that goal, we estimate that
CoStar is spending almost $1 billion annually on growth investments (and will have spent
more than $3 billion cumulatively by the end of this year), but this investment has yet to
generate meaningful revenue. Expanding losses at Homes.com have obscured rapid growth
in the core business and reduced consolidated EBITDA by approximately 80%.
The market is increasingly questioning the magnitude and duration of future losses, and
investment performance has stagnated. After compounding at a ~25% IRR for two decades
following its IPO, the stock has now been flat for more than five years, underperforming
indices and peers by wide margins.
Page 3

After several years of uncertainty, we believe it is time for CoStar to begin the journey of
meaningful self-help. During the first quarter, we engaged with the company and its founder
and CEO, Andy Florance, with the goal of helping the company improve its capital allocation
framework. CoStar agreed to add three new directors (all of whom have deep capital
allocation experience), create a Capital Allocation Committee of its Board of Directors tasked
with establishing a rigorous framework for future capital deployment, including that of
Homes.com, and review its executive compensation programs to ensure management’s
incentives remain aligned with stockholder value creation. Third Point has signed a standstill
agreement that lasts for less than one year, and while results will not be immediate, we
expect to see a meaningful improvement in capital allocation by YE 2025.
As CoStar’s core business continues to compound value and improved capital allocation
starts to narrow the losses at Homes.com, we believe the company can grow EBITDA by a
factor of >7x over the next few years, setting the stage for the stock to regain its star status.
Corporate Credit
Credit markets were relatively strong the first two months of 2025, supported by light net
new issuance and the sharp decline in interest rates. These gains round-tripped in March as
concerning tariff rhetoric began to crystallize into action. Our corporate credit portfolio was
up marginally on a gross basis in Q1 but declined by about 30 basis points on a net basis.
Following quarter-end, the market suffered its most violent selloff since Covid from the
“Liberation Day” tariff announcement, and while some losses were recouped, we expect
volatility to remain extremely elevated. Even before the tariff tantrum, our thesis was that
consumer weakness and persistent inflation would cause more dislocations this year, and
thus more opportunities for us.
While any long exposure feels like too much in a decline such as the “Liberation Day” purge,
we believe our credit book is in very good shape. As always, we are invested in relatively
liquid names with larger capitalizations that we believe give these companies more levers to
pull when the capital markets become difficult. We run the portfolio without leverage and
our industry positioning is weighted in defensive sectors. That said, in indiscriminate panics,
Page 4

in our view, what you own is not as important as who else owns it. We have taken marks in
some positions that tend to have more hedge fund-oriented holders. Credits that are
rumored to be heavily owned by the highly leveraged multi-manager platforms have been
whacked particularly hard. This is the first selloff where this technical has contributed to
meaningful volatility and we expect to take advantage of these dislocations going forward.
We expect to see many compelling opportunities in the months ahead as the market digests
the tariff impact on leveraged borrowers. This current selloff is unique: it is self-inflicted,
but we expect it will offer bargains like all other dislocations. We have a long track record of
capitalizing on these opportunities in corporate credit. While we have lost money coming
into these periods, we have made it back severalfold on the back end. There have been five
major dislocations in our book since 2008. Even excluding post-GFC performance of over
+100%, our average two-year compound returns after these selloffs were +52% gross (45%
net). While corporate credit is just a portion of the total strategy, we have taken up our
exposure during these periods and expect to find compelling opportunities to add to the
portfolio in the coming weeks.
Structured Credit
Structured Credit returned +1.5% gross (1.1% net) in the first quarter. Our portfolio is
predominately composed of fixed-rate residential mortgages (74%), in addition to consumer
asset-backed securities (20%) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (6%). During
Q1, we saw treasuries rally 40bps and credit spreads tighten through February, which
provided a tailwind to our predominately fixed rate portfolio. In March, we saw the lagged
effect of broader equity volatility as credit spreads slowly widened in tandem with Treasury
yields going lower. With heightened market volatility expected to continue, we see a few
themes emerging in structured credit:
1) We believe the rate rally is constructive for U.S. residential mortgages. We refinanced 12
reperforming mortgage securitizations despite interest rates moving 50bps higher in
2024. Fixed rate loans backed by U.S. homes are a credit defensive asset class during a
rate rally, in our view. While we may experience credit spread widening, we believe there
Page 5

will be a credit preference for U.S. mortgages where borrowers have more than 50%
equity in their homes and are locked into a fixed rate. A potential Fed rate cut or this
Treasury range (even with an offsetting credit widening) should create an opportunity
for underlying mortgages to rally. If we saw a 20% decline in house prices, the loan-to-
values of mortgages would still be around 62.5%, creating a cushion for potential
defaults. As credit markets dislocate, we believe there will be a credit tiering and
preference for first lien, owner occupied, residential exposure based on credit
fundamentals and longer duration capital specifically raised for this market sector.
2) We believe subprime consumers will continue to weaken. We have expressed concerns
about subprime auto exposure in the past, as we saw borrowers pay up for cars in 2021
and 2022 and start strategically defaulting this year as refinancing options became
scarce, and values were inflated. With additional macro headwinds, subprime consumers
are vulnerable, with savings rates declining in the face of rising unemployment. We do
not have subprime auto exposure, and our subprime unsecured and credit card exposure
is in loan form or at the senior part of the capital structure.
3) In our view, trading opportunities in credit are starting. While equity repriced, credit
markets were slower to respond but we are seeing the first signs of credit concerns
within CLOs. In March, we saw CLO mezzanine tranches move into the high single digit
to low double digit yield context. Moving forward, we anticipate a decline in dollar prices.
As we collaborate across Third Point’s credit teams, we are identifying loan issuers and
sectors with more exposure to a protectionist trade policy. The first stage is that loan
prices are declining a few points from par, and more distressed loans are down 10 points.
The second stage is when some CLO managers look to reduce exposure as loans get closer
to $80. While CLOs are non-mark-to-market vehicles, when the loans fall below $80 or
get downgraded to CCC or below, the loans are carried at the prevailing market price
instead of par. This structural feature within CLOs can create selling pressure on
leveraged loans and subsequent pressure on CLO debt tranche pricing. As an example,
when oil prices sold off in 2016, CLO BBs dropped 20-30 points in a few weeks, creating
a buying opportunity that generated two years of mid-teens returns.

We are constructive that this market volatility will present compelling investing
opportunities in credit. While significant capital has been raised for locked-up funds, we
believe the credit market will be more attractive for tactical investors like Third Point who
can provide liquidity as the uncertainty persists.

Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.

Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE NEW SERIES RETURNS The top five winners for the quarter were Meta Platforms Inc., Vistra Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Bath & Body Works Inc., and Microsoft Corp. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding hedges, were Pacific Gas & Electric Co., DuPont de Nemours Inc., Humana Inc., Marvell Technology Inc., and a Short Position. Quarterly Review and Outlook Third Point funds delivered solid results in the First Quarter, driven in part by the strong performance of large cap tech companies as well as continued gains from Bath & Body Works and Vistra. Just as during COVID when everyone became an expert in virology, today you would be hard pressed to find an investor who does not have a complex view on “macro.” Last week was a good example of equity investors’ currently mercurial nature, with the market experiencing sharp swings based on interpretations of noisy and inconclusive reports of economic data. While we don’t attempt to make short-term “macro” forecasts, our current framework is to look at three important dynamics—two economic and one structural—to guide our current allocations and where to look for new opportunities. 1) Rates and inflation: We believe that we are no longer in an inflationary economy based on our analysis of labor, rents, and other key components of inflation and thus, absolute and real rates are near the top of their ranges. 2) Economic growth and earnings: We are in the soft-landing camp and see some impending weakness in labor which could impact demand in certain sectors, but expect that future Fed action will temper the extent of future economic declines. 3) Artificial Intelligence and Energy Transition: We shared our views on AI’s transformational potential in recent letters and it is a key element of the thesis for nearly half of our equity positions today. Unlike in past periods of technological paradigm shifts, this new technology favors incumbents who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race. Right now, what we see as the best-run “legacy” companies like Microsoft and Amazon (both of which we own) have built enormous competitive advantages and seen their growth vectors accelerate. Below, we discuss London Stock Exchange Group, Alphabet and TSMC, positions whose catalysts for further value creation are primarily “AI-driven”. We also see the energy transition and growth in data centers affecting scores of industrial, materials and energy companies as demand for infrastructure and certain commodities surges. In the category of “better to be lucky than smart,” below we also share how a deep value name we acquired for its capital allocation and attractive valuation became an AI darling. Vistra Vistra is one of the largest independent power producers (“IPPs”) and retail electricity providers in the country. In 2023, Vistra’s natural gas, nuclear and coal plants generated over 20% of electricity consumed in Texas. Unlike regulated utilities, where profits are determined by capital invested, Vistra operates in deregulated markets (primarily ERCOT and PJM), where they generate and sell electricity at market prices. Historically, Vistra has been valued at a steep discount to both the regulated utility sector and the broader market in part due to the challenging fundamentals of merchant power. Stagnant domestic electricity demand combined with an oversupply of natural gas has made US electricity prices among the lowest in the world. Meanwhile, significant growth in subsidized renewable generation has created major intraday price volatility in Vistra’s core markets, with power prices sometimes going negative during periods of abundant sunshine or wind. Bankruptcies, including Vistra’s former parent company TXU in 2014, have become commonplace in the sector over the last decade. In response to this challenging environment, we believe Vistra’s capital allocation strategy has been brilliant. The company shut down unprofitable coal plants to improve its carbon footprint and mitigate oversupply. Given the market was valuing its remaining gas assets at pennies on the dollar relative to the cost of new builds, management patiently invested in maintaining the existing fleet and deployed excess cash flow into share purchases, reducing its share count by ~33% from 2018 to 2023 at an average purchase price of about 1/3 of current trading levels. In March of 2023, Vistra made its latest smart capital allocation move, acquiring the nuclear generation assets of Energy Harbor (yet another bankrupt IPP), which served as the catalyst for Third Point acquiring shares. The timing of this deal was prescient, as nuclear is finally being recognized for its merits as the only carbon-free source of 24/7 power generation. Unfortunately, onerous regulatory requirements make it very difficult to build nuclear plants economically outside of China. Vistra seems to have channeled Mark Twain and thought: “buy nuclear generation, they’re not making it anymore”. After our investment, the market started to focus on two trends that we think will have profoundly positive impacts on Vistra’s future value: increased penetration of intermittent generation (renewables), and an inflection in power demand from AI/data centers and electric vehicles. While increased renewable generation is clearly a positive for reducing CO emissions, many supporters of green energy are naïve to the impacts of solar and wind on the reliability of grids (lower) and volatility of electricity prices (higher). Price signals have become so distorted that rather than building new dispatchable (gas) power generation, we are shuttering capacity. However, when the wind stops blowing or the sun stops shining, we are increasingly reliant on huge amounts of dispatchable generation to turn on quickly, even though it may have been losing money an hour prior. Counterintuitively, electricity generated by gas in Texas has grown 30% since 2016 despite a twenty-fold increase in solar and a three-fold increase in wind. Texas recently created a $10 billion fund to incentivize new gas generation to strengthen the grid. We believe the only way to incentivize new capacity is to improve the long-term profit outlook for dispatchable gas assets via market reforms or other legislation and expect this to benefit those like Vistra who already own existing dispatchable generation. We also believe US electricity demand is poised for significant growth for the first time in decades, and Vistra’s fleet of baseload power (both nuclear and natural gas) is uniquely positioned to benefit. As the AI arms race commences, McKinsey estimates new data center build could drive an incremental 800 TWh of global electricity demand by 2030, with 40% of this driven by Generative AI1. The US is expected to capture roughly half of this demand, as bargain-basement power prices make it the world’s leading destination for new data centers despite higher labor and real estate costs. We expect data centers to drive domestic demand growth to accelerate 1-2% per annum over the next five years against a baseload supply backdrop that continues to decline as coal is phased out. Rising electric vehicle penetration is subsequently expected to add an additional 1% to annual growth (Pacific Gas & Electric, who serves a region with over 20% EV penetration, highlights that every two new EVs is equivalent to a new household in terms of demand). Because many data centers require 24/7 power (which cannot easily be provided by renewables) and connection timelines for utility grids exceed three years in some cases, hyperscalers have shown growing interest in contracting directly with nuclear plants behind the meter to ensure speedy, consistent access to electricity. For example, Amazon recently signed a 20-year agreement with nuclear operator Talen to buy power at a ~60% premium to market prices. Despite this premium, nuclear remains by far the cheapest direct source of clean energy for a hyperscaler; the estimated levelized cost of electricity for a renewables system fit to provide 24/7 power is an eyewatering $200 per MWh, roughly triple what Amazon will pay Talen2. Vistra is in the pole position to capitalize on these trends, and we expect the discount applied to their assets to continue to narrow as their business becomes increasingly essential to serving domestic power demand. London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) During Q1, we added to our position in LSEG, a mission-critical capital markets data provider that will be a beneficiary of GenAI adoption in financial services. LSEG is the No. 1 real-time data provider in capital markets with the greatest data depth, breadth, and history. LSEG has powerful network effects, as the largest global banks and asset managers have each built hundreds of applications using LSEG’s proprietary data taxonomy and standards. Over the past five years, LSEG has embraced its strength in direct data feeds and its weakness in desktop terminals (Eikon) to counter-position itself as the only scale vendor that operates an open commercial model allowing clients to freely use data outside the confines of desktop terminals and co-mingle it with other data sources. We expect far greater consumption of LSEG’s data as GenAI democratizes data interrogation. LSEG is now the only scale vendor working with Microsoft to democratize access to financial data and embed it directly into Office365 at a much lower cost than alternatives, and about to produce applications that automate simple tasks previously performed by users (e.g. Meeting Prep). We expect that LSEG/MSFT will co-develop a powerful Research Assistant application sitting on top of both LSEG’s and clients’ data estates that will meaningfully reduce the time and manpower needed to analyze data. As the financial services industry transitions from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing, we believe LSEG is ideally positioned to benefit. Alphabet During Q1, the funds made a substantial investment in Alphabet as the market worried about the impact of LLMs, personal assistants, and answer engines such as Perplexity AI on Google Search. We have owned Alphabet in the past and have long admired its exceptional business model and its proven ability to maintain a leading position across an array of preeminent products such as Search, Gmail, Android, GCP, and YouTube. The concern that in an AI world, changes in the way consumers will eventually interact with their personal devices and with the internet can result in risks to Alphabet’s core business Search is not entirely unfounded. Alphabet, however, has both a substantial distribution and technology advantage over competitors and is positioned to use its AI capabilities to unify, enhance, and better monetize the entire suite of its products. In early March, Gemini’s initial blunders further contributed to the narrative that Alphabet will end up an AI loser. Assigning primacy to a small operational misstep while demoting the fact that the company has been building world-class capabilities in AI for over a decade, created an attractive entry point for a long-term investor. While it is easy to forget that the original paper on Transformers which paved the way for the rise of LLMs was published by Google engineers, and that it was Alphabet that built two of the leading AI research organizations (Google Brain and DeepMind), when news reports previewed Apple’s intentions to embed Gemini into iOS, investors paid attention. We believe the moment when Gemini takes a seat at the economic table is approaching. As to the question of disruption of Google Search, it is important to imagine that generative AI is likely to take content creation costs to zero, not unlike when the internet took distribution costs to zero. The post-AI internet will have lower barriers to entry in a lot of content- and information-dependent industries while at the same time increasing customer acquisition costs. Google stands to benefit from this megatrend. We envision the eventuality of a world of greatly reduced content creation costs and a proliferation of information, a lot of it in the form of ad-supported content full of AI fakes. Against that backdrop, Google Search will be increasingly important as a source of truth. Despite recent efforts to contain expense growth, Alphabet full-time employees have grown at a 14% CAGR since 2017 and the median total compensation per employee, at $280,000, is the second highest among major technology companies. This excessive increase in the company’s employee base, combined with a slowdown in revenue growth, has resulted in Alphabet achieving significantly lower revenue per employee than companies like Netflix, Apple, Meta and Nvidia. However, we are encouraged by improvements evident in the most recent quarter as well as management’s decisive handling of employee unrest, in sharp contrast to its prior capitulation to a mob of angry employees in its cancellation of Project Maven in 2018. TSMC During the quarter, we added to our TSMC investment, which we initiated in May of last year. TSMC is coming off its worst year since the Global Financial Crisis, and in the years to come we see a combination of cyclical recovery plus structural growth in AI demand fueling substantial earnings growth for the company. We view TSMC as the “toll road” of the semiconductor industry, particularly for AI compute. TSMC holds more than 90% market share for leading edge semiconductor manufacturing, where all AI silicon is being processed. Beyond their reliable execution producing some of the most complex products on earth in volume, TSMC has spent decades optimizing for and building ecosystems around their 500+ customers, an advantage that cannot be replicated overnight. Today, TSMC derives a relatively small percentage of its revenues from AI processors, largely from NVDA, but we see that percentage quickly rising as AI compute broadens from just the GPU to custom accelerators. With Nvidia’s GPUs costing tens of thousands of dollars, the bulk of which go to Nvidia’s gross profit, hyperscalers are doubling down on their efforts to develop in-house silicon to alleviate AI compute’s economic burden. Google was the first mover to custom accelerators with the TPU almost 10 years ago, and today this is already a multi-billion dollar business for TSMC. Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all followed Google’s lead and have announced (and in Amazon’s case already mass producing) their own chips. As these products scale, we see TSMC’s AI revenue growing by multiples in the coming years. While TSMC’s fundamental outlook looks bright, the market has concerns which are reflected in the stock’s 10x+ discount to the SOX, the widest in TSMC’s history. The main concern is Intel’s entry into the foundry market. While we commend Intel’s efforts to diversify the global semiconductor supply chain and have admiration for the company’s rich IP and manufacturing expertise, we think it will be difficult for Intel to challenge TSMC’s dominance in foundry. Putting aside the onerous capital requirements necessary to stand up a foundry business (TSMC’s capital budget stands at ~2x Intel’s projected EBITDA), we believe the transition from internal manufacturing to an external foundry will be a difficult one. Intel has spent the past 40+ years tailoring its manufacturing process and transistor design to suit its own narrow product suite. Broadening to a multitude of customized external customer designs across a variety of end markets, in particular mobile, we believe will prove challenging. We believe TSMC has significant untapped pricing power which can be levered to offset (if not expand) its already admirable returns on capital. Advance Auto Parts We initiated a position in Advance Auto Parts in Q4 2023 at an attractive entry point, after the third consecutive guidance cut of the year overshadowed new CEO Shane O’Kelly’s strategic plans to course correct the business. Advance operates in the highly attractive auto aftermarket industry, which has proven resilient in various consumer cycles and is currently supported by increasing vehicle complexity, a growing and aging carpark, and supply and affordability challenges. While Advance has significantly underperformed peers across key KPIs over the past several years, our work suggests that many of these shortcomings aren’t structural. Feedback has been consistent that while the Advance brand is strong, a lack of relevant industry experience in key roles has led to years of inconsistent execution that has snowballed over time. We are confident that a portion of the performance gap vs. peers can be closed with new leadership and advisors in place. Key to the turnaround is CEO Shane O’Kelly, who is known as a disciplined, motivated, and proven leader with experience in similar industries. Following engagement with Third Point, the company recently added three new directors, who each bring unique and highly relevant industry experience that the former Board lacked. Tom Seboldt spent over 30 years at O’Reilly, the gold standard in the industry, as a merchandising leader and is a perfect addition given Advance can win business if they have the right parts in the right place at the right time. Brent Windom has also spent over 30 years in the auto aftermarket industry including as CEO of multiple large organizations, bringing critical operational expertise as well as experience with large-scale business transformations. Finally, Greg Smith has led complicated supply chain rationalizations at several large corporations and is a timely addition given the company’s announced plans to finally consolidate and unify its supply chain. While the long-term opportunity here lies in fixing the core retail business, the upcoming sale of Worldpac is a near-term catalyst that should unlock significant shareholder value. We believe this asset has tremendous interest from both strategic and financial buyers and is worth more than the Street is currently assuming. Proceeds from the sale will allow Advance to essentially eliminate all its outstanding net debt and likely improve its standing with credit rating agencies, accelerate the already outlined decisive actions to position the business for long term success, and return capital to shareholders. Post the Worldpac sale, RemainCo’s blended box model will look like O’Reilly and AutoZone, but at fraction of the valuation. At today’s prices, RemainCo is valued well below $2 million per store vs. O’Reilly and AutoZone that are closer to $10 million per store. We believe even minor operational improvements at the core will drive considerable upside to shares and we are confident the company now has the right leadership in place to deliver.

April 30, 2024
Dear Investor:
During the First Quarter, Third Point returned 7.8% in the flagship Offshore Fund.
1 Through March 31, 2024.
2 Annualized Return from inception (December 1996 for TP Offshore and quoted indices).
CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE NEW SERIES RETURNS
The top five winners for the quarter were Meta Platforms Inc., Vistra Corp., Amazon.com Inc.,
Bath & Body Works Inc., and Microsoft Corp. The top five losers for the quarter, excluding
hedges, were Pacific Gas & Electric Co., DuPont de Nemours Inc., Humana Inc., Marvell
Technology Inc., and a Short Position.
Quarterly Review and Outlook
Third Point funds delivered solid results in the First Quarter, driven in part by the strong
performance of large cap tech companies as well as continued gains from Bath & Body Works
and Vistra. Just as during COVID when everyone became an expert in virology, today you
would be hard pressed to find an investor who does not have a complex view on “macro.”
Last week was a good example of equity investors’ currently mercurial nature, with the
market experiencing sharp swings based on interpretations of noisy and inconclusive

reports of economic data. While we don’t attempt to make short-term “macro” forecasts, our
current framework is to look at three important dynamics—two economic and one
structural—to guide our current allocations and where to look for new opportunities.
1) Rates and inflation: We believe that we are no longer in an inflationary economy
based on our analysis of labor, rents, and other key components of inflation and thus,
absolute and real rates are near the top of their ranges.
2) Economic growth and earnings: We are in the soft-landing camp and see some
impending weakness in labor which could impact demand in certain sectors, but
expect that future Fed action will temper the extent of future economic declines.
3) Artificial Intelligence and Energy Transition: We shared our views on AI’s
transformational potential in recent letters and it is a key element of the thesis for
nearly half of our equity positions today. Unlike in past periods of technological
paradigm shifts, this new technology favors incumbents who are deploying their
financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race. Right now, what we see

Vistra
Vistra is one of the largest independent power producers (“IPPs”) and retail electricity
providers in the country. In 2023, Vistra’s natural gas, nuclear and coal plants generated
over 20% of electricity consumed in Texas.
Page 2

Unlike regulated utilities, where profits are determined by capital invested, Vistra operates

Because many data centers require 24/7 power (which cannot easily be provided by
renewables) and connection timelines for utility grids exceed three years in some cases,
hyperscalers have shown growing interest in contracting directly with nuclear plants behind
the meter to ensure speedy, consistent access to electricity. For example, Amazon recently

Amazon will pay Talen2.
Vistra is in the pole position to capitalize on these trends, and we expect the discount applied
to their assets to continue to narrow as their business becomes increasingly essential to
serving domestic power demand.
London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)
During Q1, we added to our position in LSEG, a mission-critical capital markets data provider
that will be a beneficiary of GenAI adoption in financial services. LSEG is the No. 1 real-time
data provider in capital markets with the greatest data depth, breadth, and history. LSEG
has powerful network effects, as the largest global banks and asset managers have each built
hundreds of applications using LSEG’s proprietary data taxonomy and standards. Over the
past five years, LSEG has embraced its strength in direct data feeds and its weakness in
desktop terminals (Eikon) to counter-position itself as the only scale vendor that operates
an open commercial model allowing clients to freely use data outside the confines of desktop
terminals and co-mingle it with other data sources. We expect far greater consumption of
LSEG’s data as GenAI democratizes data interrogation.
LSEG is now the only scale vendor working with Microsoft to democratize access to financial
data and embed it directly into Office365 at a much lower cost than alternatives, and about
to produce applications that automate simple tasks previously performed by users (e.g.
2 McKinsey, January 2023, “Investing in the rising data center economy”
Page 5

Meeting Prep). We expect that LSEG/MSFT will co-develop a powerful Research Assistant
application sitting on top of both LSEG’s and clients’ data estates that will meaningfully
reduce the time and manpower needed to analyze data.
As the financial services industry transitions from manual data processing via clunky
desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing, we believe LSEG is ideally positioned
to benefit.
Alphabet
During Q1, the funds made a substantial investment in Alphabet as the market worried about
the impact of LLMs, personal assistants, and answer engines such as Perplexity AI on Google
Search. We have owned Alphabet in the past and have long admired its exceptional business
model and its proven ability to maintain a leading position across an array of preeminent
products such as Search, Gmail, Android, GCP, and YouTube.
The concern that in an AI world, changes in the way consumers will eventually interact with
their personal devices and with the internet can result in risks to Alphabet’s core business
Search is not entirely unfounded. Alphabet, however, has both a substantial distribution and
technology advantage over competitors and is positioned to use its AI capabilities to unify,
enhance, and better monetize the entire suite of its products.
In early March, Gemini’s initial blunders further contributed to the narrative that Alphabet
will end up an AI loser. Assigning primacy to a small operational misstep while demoting
the fact that the company has been building world-class capabilities in AI for over a decade,
created an attractive entry point for a long-term investor. While it is easy to forget that the
original paper on Transformers which paved the way for the rise of LLMs was published by
Google engineers, and that it was Alphabet that built two of the leading AI research
organizations (Google Brain and DeepMind), when news reports previewed Apple’s
intentions to embed Gemini into iOS, investors paid attention. We believe the moment when
Gemini takes a seat at the economic table is approaching.
Page 6

As to the question of disruption of Google Search, it is important to imagine that generative
AI is likely to take content creation costs to zero, not unlike when the internet took
distribution costs to zero. The post-AI internet will have lower barriers to entry in a lot of
content- and information-dependent industries while at the same time increasing customer
acquisition costs. Google stands to benefit from this megatrend. We envision the eventuality
of a world of greatly reduced content creation costs and a proliferation of information, a lot
of it in the form of ad-supported content full of AI fakes. Against that backdrop, Google Search
will be increasingly important as a source of truth.
Despite recent efforts to contain expense growth, Alphabet full-time employees have grown
at a 14% CAGR since 2017 and the median total compensation per employee, at $280,000, is
the second highest among major technology companies. This excessive increase in the
company’s employee base, combined with a slowdown in revenue growth, has resulted in
Alphabet achieving significantly lower revenue per employee than companies like Netflix,
Apple, Meta and Nvidia. However, we are encouraged by improvements evident in the most
recent quarter as well as management’s decisive handling of employee unrest, in sharp
contrast to its prior capitulation to a mob of angry employees in its cancellation of Project
Maven in 2018.
TSMC
During the quarter, we added to our TSMC investment, which we initiated in May of last year.
TSMC is coming off its worst year since the Global Financial Crisis, and in the years to come
we see a combination of cyclical recovery plus structural growth in AI demand fueling
substantial earnings growth for the company.
We view TSMC as the “toll road” of the semiconductor industry, particularly for AI compute.
TSMC holds more than 90% market share for leading edge semiconductor manufacturing,
where all AI silicon is being processed. Beyond their reliable execution producing some of
the most complex products on earth in volume, TSMC has spent decades optimizing for and
building ecosystems around their 500+ customers, an advantage that cannot be replicated
overnight.
Page 7

Today, TSMC derives a relatively small percentage of its revenues from AI processors, largely
from NVDA, but we see that percentage quickly rising as AI compute broadens from just the
GPU to custom accelerators. With Nvidia’s GPUs costing tens of thousands of dollars, the
bulk of which go to Nvidia’s gross profit, hyperscalers are doubling down on their efforts to
develop in-house silicon to alleviate AI compute’s economic burden. Google was the first
mover to custom accelerators with the TPU almost 10 years ago, and today this is already a
multi-billion dollar business for TSMC. Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all followed
Google’s lead and have announced (and in Amazon’s case already mass producing) their own
chips. As these products scale, we see TSMC’s AI revenue growing by multiples in the coming
years.
While TSMC’s fundamental outlook looks bright, the market has concerns which are reflected
in the stock’s 10x+ discount to the SOX, the widest in TSMC’s history. The main concern is
Intel’s entry into the foundry market. While we commend Intel’s efforts to diversify the
global semiconductor supply chain and have admiration for the company’s rich IP and
manufacturing expertise, we think it will be difficult for Intel to challenge TSMC’s dominance
in foundry. Putting aside the onerous capital requirements necessary to stand up a foundry
business (TSMC’s capital budget stands at ~2x Intel’s projected EBITDA), we believe the
transition from internal manufacturing to an external foundry will be a difficult one. Intel
has spent the past 40+ years tailoring its manufacturing process and transistor design to suit
its own narrow product suite. Broadening to a multitude of customized external customer
designs across a variety of end markets, in particular mobile, we believe will prove
challenging.
We believe TSMC has significant untapped pricing power which can be levered to offset (if
not expand) its already admirable returns on capital.
Advance Auto Parts
We initiated a position in Advance Auto Parts in Q4 2023 at an attractive entry point, after
the third consecutive guidance cut of the year overshadowed new CEO Shane O’Kelly’s
Page 8

strategic plans to course correct the business. Advance operates in the highly attractive auto
aftermarket industry, which has proven resilient in various consumer cycles and is currently
supported by increasing vehicle complexity, a growing and aging carpark, and supply and
affordability challenges.
While Advance has significantly underperformed peers across key KPIs over the past several
years, our work suggests that many of these shortcomings aren’t structural. Feedback has
been consistent that while the Advance brand is strong, a lack of relevant industry
experience in key roles has led to years of inconsistent execution that has snowballed over
time. We are confident that a portion of the performance gap vs. peers can be closed with
new leadership and advisors in place.
Key to the turnaround is CEO Shane O’Kelly, who is known as a disciplined, motivated, and
proven leader with experience in similar industries. Following engagement with Third Point,
the company recently added three new directors, who each bring unique and highly relevant
industry experience that the former Board lacked. Tom Seboldt spent over 30 years at
O’Reilly, the gold standard in the industry, as a merchandising leader and is a perfect addition
given Advance can win business if they have the right parts in the right place at the right
time. Brent Windom has also spent over 30 years in the auto aftermarket industry including
as CEO of multiple large organizations, bringing critical operational expertise as well as
experience with large-scale business transformations. Finally, Greg Smith has led
complicated supply chain rationalizations at several large corporations and is a timely
addition given the company’s announced plans to finally consolidate and unify its supply
chain.
While the long-term opportunity here lies in fixing the core retail business, the upcoming
sale of Worldpac is a near-term catalyst that should unlock significant shareholder value. We
believe this asset has tremendous interest from both strategic and financial buyers and is
worth more than the Street is currently assuming. Proceeds from the sale will allow Advance
to essentially eliminate all its outstanding net debt and likely improve its standing with credit

rating agencies, accelerate the already outlined decisive actions to position the business for
long term success, and return capital to shareholders.
Post the Worldpac sale, RemainCo’s blended box model will look like O’Reilly and AutoZone,
but at fraction of the valuation. At today’s prices, RemainCo is valued well below $2 million
per store vs. O’Reilly and AutoZone that are closer to $10 million per store. We believe even
minor operational improvements at the core will drive considerable upside to shares and we
are confident the company now has the right leadership in place to deliver.

The information contained herein is being provided to the investors in Third Point Investors Limited (the “Company”), a feeder fund listed
on the London Stock Exchange that invests substantially all of its assets in Third Point Offshore Fund, Ltd (“Third Point Offshore”). Third
Point Offshore is managed by Third Point LLC (“Third Point” or “Investment Manager”), an SEC-registered investment adviser
headquartered in New York. Third Point Offshore is a feeder fund to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. in a master-feeder structure.
Third Point LLC , an SEC registered investment adviser, is the Investment Manager to the Funds.
Unless otherwise specified, all information contained herein relates to the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. inclusive of legacy private
investments. P&L and AUM information are presented at the feeder fund level where applicable.. Sector and geographic categories are
determined by Third Point in its sole discretion.
Performance results are presented net of management fees, brokerage commissions, administrative expenses, and accrued performance
allocation, if any, and include the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains. While performance allocations are accrued
monthly, they are deducted from investor balances only annually or upon withdrawal. From the inception of Third Point Offshore through
December 31, 2019, the fund's historical performance has been calculated using the actual management fees and performance allocations
paid by the fund. The actual management fees and performance allocations paid by the fund reflect a blended rate of management fees and
performance allocations based on the weighted average of amounts invested in different share classes subject to different management fee
and/or performance allocation terms. Such management fee rates have ranged over time from 1% to 2% per annum. The amount of
performance allocations applicable to any one investor in the fund will vary materially depending on numerous factors, including without
limitation: the specific terms, the date of initial investment, the duration of investment, the date of withdrawal, and market conditions. As
such, the net performance shown for Third Point Offshore from inception through December 31, 2019 is not an estimate of any specific
investor’s actual performance. For the period beginning January 1, 2020, the fund’s historical performance shows indicative performance
for a new issues eligible investor in the highest management fee (2% per annum) and performance allocation (20%) class of the fund, who
has participated in all side pocket private investments (as applicable) from March 1, 2021 onward. The inception date for Third Point
Offshore Fund Ltd is December 1, 1996. All performance results are estimates and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results.
The net P&L figures are included because of the SEC’s new marketing rule and guidance. Third Point does not believe that this metric
accurately reflects net P&L for the referenced sub-portfolio group of investments as explained more fully below. Specifically, net P&L
returns reflect the allocation of the highest management fee (2% per annum), in addition to leverage factor multiple, if applicable, and
incentive allocation rate (20%), and an assumed operating expense ratio (0.3%), to the aggregate underlying positions in the referenced
sub-portfolio group’s gross P&L. The management fees and operating expenses are allocated for the period proportionately based on the
average gross exposures of the aggregate underlying positions of the referenced sub-portfolio group. The implied incentive allocation is
based on the deduction of the management fee and expense ratio from Third Point Offshore fund level gross P&L attribution for the period.
The incentive allocation is accrued for each period to only those positions within the referenced sub-portfolio group with i) positive P&L
and ii) if during the current MTD period there is an incentive allocation. In MTD periods where there is a reversal of previously accrued
incentive allocation, the impact of the reversal will be based on the previous month’s YTD accrued incentive allocation. The assumed
operating expense ratio noted herein is applied uniformly across all underlying positions in the referenced sub-portfolio group given the
inherent difficulty in determining and allocating the expenses on a sub-portfolio group basis. If expenses were to be allocated on a sub-
portfolio group basis, the net P&L would likely be different for each referenced investment or sub-portfolio group, as applicable.
While the performances of the fund has been compared here with the performance of well-known and widely recognized indices, the
indices have not been selected to represent an appropriate benchmark for the fund whose holdings, performance and volatility may differ
significantly from the securities that comprise the indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All information
